       "\" The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, responsible for mediating the majority of intracellular proteolysis, plays a crucial role in the regulation of many normal cellular processes, including the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis !!!REFs!!!. Defects in proteasome function have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease !!!REF!!!. Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells characterized by nuclear fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome release and caspase activation !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and AcLLNaI induce apoptotic death in human glioma cells by a mitochondria-independent mechanism !!!REF!!!. In addition, it is uncertain whether the cytotoxicity of MG132 is mediated by elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ levels !!!REFs!!!. Disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and defects in mitochondrial function mediate neuronal cell death !!!REFs!!!. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species !!!REF!!!. Ca2+ overload may excessively activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathways and leads to irreversible cell damage !!!REF!!!. Calmodulin antagonists such as W-7 and trifluoperazine inhibit cell death due to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or veratridine-induced depolarization !!!REFs!!!. Trifluoperazine as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition is demonstrated to reduce oxidative stress-induced cell death by suppressing the cytochrome release and mitochondrial depolarization !!!REFs!!!. Meanwhile, phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, show a strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against neuronal cells and leukemic cells !!!REFs!!!. MG132, which effectively blocks the proteolytic activity of 26S proteasome complex, causes apoptotic cell death through formation of ROS !!!REFs!!!. Although calmodulin antagonist such as trifluoperazine is demonstrated to reduce oxidative cell injury, the effect on mitochondrial damage and apoptotic cell death due to MG132 has not been elucidated. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine, W-7 and calmidazolium) on the MG132-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in PC12 cells. This study examined the effect of calmodulin antagonists on mitochondrial damage and subsequent cytochrome release, changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, formation of ROS and cellular GSH contents.                             Of all sleep disorders, insomnia is the most prevalent among adults. The estimated population prevalence of difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep is about 30%, while the prevalence of frequent, severe insomnia is reported as being closer to 10–15% (e.g. !!!REF!!!). Different estimates of the prevalence of insomnia reflect the fact that the difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep have been variously regarded as a complaint, a disorder, a symptom, a disease and a finding !!!REF!!!. At present, most researchers consider the duration and severity criteria proposed by the DSM-IV !!!REF!!! and by the ICSD-R !!!REF!!! classifications as the “standard” for the definition of insomnia. Both classifications assign a crucial role to the subjective complaint of insufficient or inadequate sleep. Current clinical guidelines have given less emphasize to the relevance of objective data (poligraphic recordings) in the diagnosis of insomnia which are now primarily based on what the patients report !!!REFs!!!. Self-report questionnaires have for a long time been the easiest and most widely used method of collecting data for epidemiological studies on insomnia and on other sleep impairments. Questionnaires and structured interviews could be used for screening purposes within the early stage of clinical assessment !!!REF!!!. Unfortunately, however, most paper and pencil instruments are either very long or do not include all the questions necessary for the assessment of the severity of the complaint according to current standards. In order to obtain an adequate recognition of insomnia an interview or a questionnaire should consider the main aspects, which characterize the disorder according to both the DSM-IV and ICSD-R diagnostic systems and to recent consensus reports !!!REF!!!. These aspects include symptoms intensity, frequency, and duration of sleep difficulties, as well as their impact on daytime functioning. With regards to the intensity of symptoms, insomnia is defined by a sleep-onset latency of more than 30min, and/or by awakenings after sleep onset of more than 30min, and/or by an early morning awakening !!!REF!!!. According to the DSM-IV and the ICSD-R, the co-occurrence of three criteria is required in order to establish the presence of a problem of insomnia which is both so severe and chronic to be considered relevant from a clinical point of view. These are the following: (1) the sleep disturbance must be reported as present three or more nights per week; (2) the subject must refer to a complaint of insomnia that lasts for more than 1 month; (3) the subject must state that the sleep disturbance causes significant impairment in her/his social, occupational or cognitive daytime functioning. Most of the epidemiological surveys that have so far been made have not used questionnaires based on the aforesaid criteria but have focused on a few general questions on habitual sleep quality and on the type of sleep disturbance !!!REFs!!!. More recently standard criteria have been used in studies based on Computer Aided Telephone Interviews—CATI !!!REFs!!!. However, it is difficult to reconcile the systematic scientific soundness of CATI methods with the necessities of screening and clinical settings, in which for practical reasons the use of brief paper and pencil questionnaires is often recommended. Different self-reported measures of sleep disturbances have been used in screenings and in clinical settings. Among the most widely used, some focus specifically on the daytime consequences of insomnia (the Sleep Impairment Index !!!REF!!!) while others focus on the cognitive aspects of the disorder (Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale !!!REF!!!; Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire !!!REF!!!). Most questionnaires assess insomnia symptoms and sleep dissatisfaction (e.g. Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SDQ) !!!REF!!!; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) !!!REF!!!) but they do not ask for a subjective evaluation of insomnia according to the criteria considered by the DSM-IV or ICSD-R. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is among the most widely used and validated sleep disorder questionnaires. The PSQI is not designed to define the presence of insomnia, but to assess different features of sleep quality. The psychometric proprieties of the PSQI have been extensively evaluated in different non-clinical groups of subjects !!!REFs!!!, in patients with psychiatric and sleep disorders !!!REFs!!!, with somatic diseases !!!REF!!! and with primary insomnia !!!REF!!!. In order to define the presence of insomnia, on the ground of previous research !!!REFs!!!, we have developed a brief questionnaire bounded to a precise definition of insomnia to be used for preliminary detection and pre-assessment of this sleep disorder. The questionnaire, called SDQ, allows an evaluation of insomnia based on DSM-IV and ICSD-R criteria. Pilot studies have shown that the SDQ is well understood and that it can be completed and scored in a few minutes !!!REFs!!!. In the present paper we report two different studies which were carried out in order to assess the validity of the SDQ as a self-report measure of insomnia. In the first study the convergent validity of the SDQ was evaluated by considering the global score of the PSQI as criterion in a sample of patients waiting for a primary care visit. In the second study, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the SDQ in discriminating between subjects diagnosed as insomniacs and subjects established as normal sleepers within an extensive clinical evaluation given to college students.  Homeothermic animals keep the constant levels of body temperature. But heat stress disrupts the body temperature control, and induces hyperthermia and dehydration, which is accompanied by hyperosmolarity and hypovolemia. Homeothermic animals have the defensive responses to these phenomena. The defensive responses are difficult to clarify, due to the integral responses acting on many regulations, such as thermoregulation, fluid regulation and so on. The role of the central nervous system in thermoregulation is well established, and especially hypothalamus is important. The preoptic area (POA) and anterior hypothalamic area (AH) in the hypothalamus are known as the thermoregulatory center !!!REF!!!, and heat stress activates these regions !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, a warm stimulation of these regions activates the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SO), and lateral hypothalamic area (LH) !!!REFs!!!, and also induces thermolysis following vasodilatation through the medial forebrain bundle !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, hypothalamus is important in fluid regulation. Lesions of the POA, LH and zona incerta disrupt drinking !!!REFs!!!, and the POA, PVN and SO are activated by dehydration !!!REF!!!. Accordingly, a large part of the hypothalamus has been thought to act on thermoregulation and fluid regulation. There have been many reports that heat stress activates numerous regions in the hypothalamus, especially the POA and AH !!!REFs!!!. However, these reports are generally based on one temperature condition, and different results have been observed. For example, heat stress activate the PVN in some reports !!!REFs!!! and not in others !!!REFs!!!. It was thought that the differences in the activated regions were brought about by the differences between heat stress conditions. Body temperature in homeothermic animals generally increases in heat stress, and then the homeothermic animals primarily induce vasomotor responses due to thermolysis. Body temperature further increases, and then the homeothermic animals secondarily induce evaporative water loss such as sweating in humans !!!REF!!!, thermal panting in dogs !!!REF!!! and rabbits !!!REF!!! and salivation in rodents !!!REF!!!. Accordingly, there are at least two physiological conditions, which are only hyperthermia and both hyperthermia and dehydration, in heat stress and it is necessary for heat stress responses to be investigated for each physiological condition. Especially, the two physiological conditions in heat stress clearly exist in rodents, because rodents generally do not utilize salivation for thermolysis until the exposed temperature exceeds 36–40°C !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, the distinction between thermoregulation and fluid regulation is necessary for investigation of heat stress responses. In previous study, water deprivation was used to investigate the difference in activated hypothalamic regions between thermoregulation and osmoregulation in heat stress !!!REF!!!. But, we questioned whether the dehydration by water deprivation was the same by evaporative water loss. In this study, we investigated activated hypothalamic regions in mice under two heat stress conditions, 34 and 38.5°C, which induced only hyperthermia and both hyperthermia and dehydration. This attempt may distinguish between hypothalamic regions of thermoregulation and fluid regulation in heat stress. Using the immunostaining for Fos protein, which was frequently used in neuroendocrinological studies, including heat stress as a maker of the activated neuron !!!REFs!!!, the number of activated neurons in each region of the hypothalamus was examined. Furthermore, we previously reported that food consumption decreased above 34°C, and that corticosterone (CORT) and vasopressin (AVP) levels in the blood increased above 37°C in heat stress !!!REF!!!. The relationships between the activated hypothalamic regions and the physiological and neuroendocrinological changes in heat stress were unclear, and were also discussed in this study.  The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a large, ubiquitously expressed, membrane spanning glycoprotein which is endoproteolytically processed to a 4-kDa, 39–43 amino acid residue, called the β-amyloid peptide (βAP), that is the major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) !!!REF!!!. The major or normal route of APP processing is via the α-secretase pathway, which is incompatible with the formation of βAP. This non-amyloidogenic metabolism yields neuroprotective, soluble form of APP (sAPPα) !!!REF!!!. The amyloidogenic pathway is an alternative of APP processing, involving cleavage of the precursor by β- and γ-secretases !!!REF!!!; as a result, neurotoxic βAP is produced. The strong structural conservation within the superfamily and ubiquitous expression within the body indicate an important function for APP and APP-like proteins !!!REF!!!. They play a role in the regulation of neurite growth, intracellular calcium levels, cytokine release, promotion of neuronal survival, and cell adhesion in neuronal cells !!!REF!!!. It has also been proposed that APP is a cell-surface receptor !!!REF!!!. However, a specific soluble ligand that binds to surface-inserted APP with receptor-like kinetics has not been identified. Potential support for a receptor-like function of APP is the observation that the precursor can associate with the GTP-binding protein Go via a motif in the APP cytoplasmic domain !!!REF!!!. Just as APP is essential for the organism’s survival, disturbance of its regulation appears to participate in this astounding human disease, AD, by yielding freely floating βAP. During the course of the disorder, AD patients may develop behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that require antipsychotic medication. Recent reports demonstrate that AD pathology is infrequent in patients with schizophrenia (SCH) !!!REFs!!!, and it has been proposed that antipsychotic medications used to treat SCH might actually have a protective effect against developing AD neuropathology. Traditional antipsychotic haloperidol (HAL) is dopamine-2 (D2) and sigma-1 (σ1) receptor antagonist with apoptotic activity !!!REFs!!!. HAL is involved in neurotoxicity, causing clinically troublesome adverse events such as extrapyramidal and cardiac side-effects !!!REF!!!. HAL was also demonstrated to efficiently inhibit βAP formation from APP in vitro !!!REF!!!. The mechanism by which it might exert such an effect is not known. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic risperidone (RISP) is a high potential D2, serotonine (5-HT2) and noradrenergic (NA) antagonist with less adverse effects then conventional antipsychotics. RISP has no known effect on AD pathology, including APP metabolism. In light of evidence that HAL—one of the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic medications used in the treatment of SCH !!!REF!!!—interferes with APP processing, we evaluated HAL for its effects on APP metabolism in vivo; we have also examined RISP in this regard.  Peripherally produced steroids circulate in the bloodstream to organs such as the brain, which has a rich blood supply. By selective absorption through the blood–brain barrier, astrocytes may take up peripheral steroids, and further metabolise them into neuroactive steroids !!!REF!!!. However, relatively recent discoveries have found that steroids may also be synthesised in the central nervous system (CNS), and are termed “neurosteroids” (!!!REF!!! ) !!!REF!!!. These steroids are produced independently of the peripheral supply. It has been proposed that such synthesis by the brain can avoid sharp fluctuations of steroid concentrations, or boost steroid concentrations in the brain to higher than that of the periphery to arrive at physiologically active concentrations in certain brain regions. However, not all peripheral steroidogenic enzymes have been detected in the brain thus far, generally due to their lower activity in the CNS, meaning that more sensitive techniques are required to find evidence of their expression !!!REFs!!!. Studies into the role of astrocytes as peripheral support cells in normal neuronal functioning has raised the question over whether astrocytes are capable of synthesising de novo a number of progesterone (P) metabolites including tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). To study this hypothesis we used the brain tissue from 2- to 3-day-old Sprague–Dawley rat pups for the culturing of highly purified type 1 astrocytes. Purification of cultures made use of l-leucine methyl ester (l-LME) to eliminate contaminating microglia. l-LME is a lysosomotropic agent (apoptosis inducer) used in cultures of peripheral immune cells (B & T cells) to remove damaging monocytes !!!REF!!!. l-LME is also capable of reducing microglia (brain macrophage) populations in mixed glial cultures, in order to increase the purity of astrocytes. Research indicates that l-LME is effective at reducing populations of microglial cells to approximately 0.5%, as confirmed by specific staining of cell receptors !!!REF!!!. Recently, studies have shown that P450c17 expression in astrocytes is inhibited by the presence of microglia in culture, hence it is desirable to use l-LME to reduce the presence of microglia prior to use of cultures !!!REFs!!!. 21-Hydroxylase (P450c21) is physiologically important, as the product (deoxycorticosterone, DOC) may be indirectly converted to the neuroactive steroid THDOC. THDOC can be exported out of the cell and bind at GABAA receptors present on adjacent neurons, and thus alter the action potential. Considerable controversy exists over the nature of extra-adrenal 21-hydroxylation in the rat. Whilst some evidence has been found of the adrenal 21-hydroxylase enzyme in specific regions of the brain via antibody-based studies !!!REFs!!!, the presence of the enzyme product (DOC, or DHDOC/THDOC) has not been found. However, these steroids have been identified entering the brain through the blood–brain barrier !!!REF!!!. Mellon and co-workers have also proposed that a different enzyme system altogether may be involved !!!REFs!!!. In 1996, the rat 21-hydroxylase enzyme was cloned and two separate transcripts, 21-OH-5 and 21-OH-6 sequenced !!!REFs!!!. The two transcripts are believed to result from alternative splicing of the same RNA, however only 21-OH-5 is translated into active protein. Southern blotting and RT–PCR were used to demonstrate the expression of 21-hydroxylase in various organs such as kidney, aorta, liver, cerebellum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Expression of both constructs was detected in all tissues except cerebrum and hippocampus, but higher expression was found in the cerebellum and hypothalamus. Thus, it was proposed that the rat peripheral P450c21 is responsible for both peripheral and CNS 21-hydroxylation. To date no study has investigated whether astrocytes are capable of de novo synthesis of THDOC, in addition to the well characterised role in the production of THP. As a sensitive technique has been shown to be required for the detection of P450c21, it is likely that expression may be low for the production of small levels of neurosteroids that are active at an autocrine level in specific areas of the brain !!!REF!!!. Further evidence of this is shown by the fact that some recent studies have been able to find evidence for the first time of 21-hydroxylase expression in the human brain, using such techniques as a sensitive nested RT–PCR !!!REFs!!!. Hence, this study aimed to use both electrospray mass spectroscopy (ESMS) and molecular biology techniques to determine if type 1 astrocyte cultures derived from newborn rats are capable of the expression of P450c21.  The use of a stereotaxic instrument and atlas with coordinates are essential for reliable approaches to certain nuclei of the brain. Stereotaxic atlases are available for the rat !!!REFs!!!, rabbit !!!REF!!!, cat !!!REFs!!!, goat !!!REFs!!!, sheep !!!REF!!!, pig !!!REFs!!!, and monkey !!!REFs!!!. By using stereotaxic approaches in these animals, substantial data have been provided which reveal crucial roles of the central nuclei in the regulation of food intake !!!REFs!!!, water consumption !!!REFs!!!, thermoregulation !!!REFs!!!, reproduction !!!REFs!!!, learning and memory !!!REFs!!!, and emotional behaviors !!!REFs!!!. In relation to development of the bovine stereotaxic instrument, Das and McClure !!!REF!!! reported sizes of the skulls and heads from five different breeds of cattle. An atlas of the brain in the Holstein–Friesian breed was first presented by Yoshikawa !!!REF!!!, but no stereotaxic reference exists in his drawings. Recently, the stereotaxic approach to the ventricle of heifers or calves has been reported in studies by Ames et al. !!!REF!!!, Helund et al. !!!REF!!!, and Leshin et al. !!!REF!!!. In those papers, however, there is no full description of the bovine stereotaxic instrument, and no coordinates of intracerebral nuclei have been provided. Thus, stereotaxic studies are very limited in cattle and, to our knowledge, no practical stereotaxic instrument is available for this animal from weanling to adult age. Therefore, in this study, we have newly developed a stereotaxic instrument for cattle and provide reference measurements of the distances between the skull and head landmarks necessary to undertake stereotaxic surgery in Holstein calves and cows.  The β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) is postulated to have neurotropic properties !!!REFs!!!. The role of the protein in protecting neurons is supported by studies that show that β-APP is upregulated during stressful conditions. The synthesis of β-APP in astrocytes increases after treatment with interleukin (IL)-1 !!!REF!!! and transient ischemic changes modulate the expression of β-APP mRNA in the rat cerebral cortex !!!REF!!!. The proteolysis of the large trans-membrane protein β-APP by β- and γ-secretases produces the 1–40 and 1–42 peptides. β-Amyloid peptide (β-AP, a 40–42 amino acid peptide) is the main component of amyloid deposits around the cerebral vessel and in brain parenchima in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and in subjects with Down syndrome !!!REF!!!. The in vitro studies on neuronal cells or on PC12 and Hela cell lines have shown that the aggregate form of β-AP is toxic !!!REFs!!!. Many genetic and environmental factors including metal ions, proteoglycans, plasma proteins and antioxidants modify β-AP toxicity. Four main mechanisms of toxicity have been suggested: (a) several lines of evidence show abnormalities in cell redox systems. The decrease of reduction of the tetrazolium redox dye (MTT test) appears to be a specific indicator of β-AP toxicity; (b) β-AP increases the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Increased formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species appears to be an early event in the toxicity of many amyloidogenic proteins; (c) perturbations of neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis are observed in the presence of β-AP; (d) the hyperphosphorylation of protein Tau on Ser residues determines the intraneuronal accumulation of paired helical filaments, a typical histological lesion in Alzheimer’s disease !!!REF!!!. β-AP appears also to act in a cytokine-like manner and promote inflammatory events. For example, β-AP and interferon-γ, as well as IL-1β, activate microglia !!!REFs!!!. These reactive glial cells increase NO production !!!REF!!! and also activate complement !!!REFs!!!. β-AP has also been shown to exacerbate oxidative events in these cells !!!REFs!!!. Recent studies have demonstrated that β-AP directly generates hydroxyl radicals by the reduction of Fe and Cu !!!REFs!!!. Parallel to the function of interleukines, the subsequent secretion of β-AP may be an integral part of an innate immune response of the CNS against pathological conditions. If the disturbance is not resolved, the chronic production of these potentially harmful substances can lead to neurodegeneration. As shown by many epidemiological studies, diets with high contents of vegetables are cardioprotective !!!REFs!!!. Some studies also showed a possible protective effect of vegetables rich diets on brain degenerative processes !!!REFs!!!. The protective activities have been related to the high content in polyphenols and phytoestrogens of vegetables, fruits and beverages (for example, wine and tea). These compounds have antioxidant activity, chelate transition metal ions, interfere with transduction pathways involving protein phosphorilation and ion movements and are active on cell redox systems !!!REFs!!!. We have investigated, on PC12 cells, the protective effect from β-AP (1–41) toxicity of two compounds, resveratrol (a stilbene derivative) and catechin (a flavonoid), which have different biological activities and are present in several vegetables and beverages. Their effect has been also investigated on the toxicity of a fragment of β-AP, the (25–35) peptide, which is toxic as well.  Our previous behavioral studies !!!REFs!!! demonstrated that prenatal morphine exposure alters locomotion, cognition, and stress responses in adult male and female rats. There are many brain regions that play an important role in these behavioral and neural processes. The cerebral cortex (CX) is primarily involved in processing sensory information, delivering motor commands, behavioral planning, or cognitive capabilities of the brain !!!REF!!!. The cingulate CX (cgCX) is a separate division of the CX involved in emotions and reward-related motivated behaviors such as drugs of abuse !!!REFs!!!. Another brain region closely connected to the CX and involved in planning and programming of voluntary movements is the striatum (STR), a part of basal ganglia !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of prenatal morphine exposure on μ-opioid receptor densities in these brain regions involved in execution of some behaviors. There is contradictory evidence showing that chronic administration of morphine to adult rats down-regulates !!!REFs!!!, up-regulates !!!REFs!!!, or has no effect !!!REF!!! on cortical and striatal μ- and/or δ-opioid receptor characteristics. These opioid receptor changes, can be reversed by opiate antagonists, naloxone or naltrexone !!!REFs!!!. There are fewer studies on the effect of prenatal opioid exposure on opioid receptors. Zadina et al. !!!REF!!! showed that chronic prenatal administration of β-endorphin increases the number of μ-opioid receptors in the brain of offspring on postnatal day (PND) 14, but this effect does not persist to adulthood. Zagon et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated that prenatal exposure to naloxone down-regulates the binding capacity but not the affinity of μ-opioid receptors in the rat brain, investigated during development and in adulthood. However, both Zadina !!!REF!!! and Zagon !!!REF!!! examined changes in opioid receptors in the whole brain rather than in specific brain regions. We have evidence !!!REF!!! demonstrating that prenatal morphine exposure decreases δ-opioid receptors in the CX of gonadectomized (GNX), adult male rats. The effect of prenatal morphine exposure is not apparent in gonadally intact or GNX, testosterone 17β-propionate (TP)-treated adult male rats. Our other work !!!REFs!!! shows that prenatal morphine exposure increases μ-opioid receptor density in the nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and some nuclei of amygdala. However, while we demonstrated !!!REF!!! that a single testosterone injection is able to return the density of δ-opioid receptors in GNX males to the level of gonadally intact males, the same testosterone treatment did not affect the density of μ-opioid receptors !!!REFs!!!. We suggested the possibility that μ-opioid receptors are less sensitive to a single TP injection than δ-opioid receptors although different brain regions were examined for δ- !!!REF!!! and μ-opioid receptors !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, to test this hypothesis, the present autoradiographic study investigated μ-opioid receptor density in male rats in the same brain regions (CX and STR) as in the δ-opioid receptor study !!!REF!!!. Further, our δ autoradiography work !!!REF!!! showed that the density of δ-opioid receptors in the cgCX is higher than in any other cortical layers. Moreover, there is evidence that μ-opioid receptors are also highly expressed in the cgCX !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of prenatal morphine exposure (on gestational days 11–18) on μ-opioid receptor densities in the CX, cgCX, and STR of both adult male and female rats.  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the excitatory amino acids ionotropic and metabotropic receptors are involved in learning and memory processes !!!REFs!!!. It is considered that direct phasic glutamate activation of both receptor groups, subserves different forms of neuronal plasticity, involving the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), in the brain limbic structures. The role of the hippocampal formation is of particular interest in this regard. Intra-cerebroventricular administration of ()-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a non-selective mGluR antagonist, prevented LTP in dentate gyrus of freely moving rats !!!REFs!!!. The opposite effect, i.e. facilitation of LTP in dentate gyrus in vivo, was reported after metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, -azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (tADA) !!!REF!!!. A limited number of experimental data confirms the involvement of group 1 mGluRs in learning processes. Peripherally and intra-hippocampally administered MCPG and AIDA (a selective mGluR1 antagonist), prior to training session, blocked the memory of context-specific conditioned fear !!!REF!!!. Pre-trial administration of MPEP, a mGluR5 antagonist, also inhibited fear conditioning in rats !!!REF!!!. These findings underscore the role of hippocampal group I mGluRs in the acquisition phase of learning and memory. However, less is known about the neural processes engaged in the consolidation of memory, and on the role of different mGluRs subtypes in the hippocampal formation, in this phase of processing of a memory trace. Some limited data indicated an important role of mGluRs in this respect !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present study was to further explore this problem, which has potentially important clinical implications, given the lack of an effective pro-cognitive treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this context it is noteworthy that the central effects of glutamate arise as the result of a balance between its synaptic excitatory and neurotoxic properties. Accordingly, it is well recognized that non-compensated increase in synaptic concentrations of glutamate may lead to disorganization of neural processes with consequent neurodegeneration. In the present study, the effects of post-training, intra-hippocampal (dorsal part; the area of dentate gyrus) administration of group I mGluRs agonist and antagonist on consolidation of memory in the contextual fear conditioning test, were examined in rats. Furthermore, in order to establish the role of local mGluRs in the analyzed central processes, related to neuronal plasticity, we have performed as an accessory experiment immunocytochemical analysis of expression of c-Fos protein (a marker of neuronal activation), in particular subregions of the hippocampus after pretreatment of rats with AIDA, a mGluR1 antagonist.  Major depression and anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder are associated with morphological and functional changes in the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Clinical studies have shown that stressful experiences, like severe and sequential life events, are important etiological factors in the development of affective disorders !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, it has been reported in humans and experimental animals that stress, particularly chronic stress, can affect brain activity and induce localized structural changes and neuronal damage !!!REFs!!!. Dysfunction of the medial and orbital PFC can disarrange the adequate processing of emotional stimuli (i.e. severe stressors) !!!REFs!!!. Post-mortem studies of patients suffering of major depression have shown decreased number and size of neurons and glia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a related decreased volume of the mPFC !!!REFs!!!. In addition, neuroimaging studies in depressed subjects and subjects suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder showed disturbed cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity of the mPFC (hypofrontality) !!!REFs!!!, which could be improved by antidepressant treatment with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) !!!REF!!!. Also in rats, the mPFC is important for neuroendocrine and autonomic responses to stressful situations. Particularly, the prelimbic and infralimbic regions have been shown to modulate hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity and are involved in glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback mechanisms !!!REF!!!. Several tracing studies have shown that the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices project to a number of diencephalic, brainstem, and spinal control centers and to limbic areas including the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which may enable direct and indirect modulation of autonomic functions !!!REFs!!!. Affective disorders occur approximately twice as often in women as in men !!!REFs!!! which may be partly explained by neurobiological effects of circulating ovarian hormones. Estrogen can modulate the function of the serotonergic system !!!REFs!!!, the limbic activity !!!REF!!!, and the HPA axis !!!REFs!!!. Biological differences in stress processing between men and women could underlie the higher liability for stress-related diseases in females. The aim of this study was to investigate whether experimentally induced hypofrontality in rats will increase their stress vulnerability. We used female rats because of their suspected increased sensitivity to chronic stress and because of the considerable relevance for the human affective disorder research and the lack of information concerning the development of stress-related pathology in female rats. These data may provide new insight into the role of the mPFC in dealing with chronic stress, and the consequences of mPFC damage for coping with consecutive stressful events.  Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a complex etiology comprising both genetic and environmental factors. In PD, dopamine cells of the substantia nigra (SN) unexpectedly die resulting in bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability (for review see Ref. !!!REF!!!). The defining neurological feature of idiopathic PD is the accumulation of Lewy bodies, small spherical inclusions, which are often found in the SN and locus coeruleus (LC). It is hypothesized that these cytosolic inclusions or related aggregates are involved in triggering the demise of dopamine cells of the midbrain !!!REFs!!!. The finding of large numbers of Lewy bodies in the parkinsonian brain also suggests that such inclusions are sites specialized for proteolysis or, alternatively, that the inclusions resist protein degradation, thereby altering the capacity of dopamine neurons for protein turnover. Regardless of the mechanisms at work here, if the dopamine cell is unable to handle the build-up of abnormal polypeptides, a program of cell death (or apoptosis) may be initiated (for review see Ref. !!!REF!!!). Apoptosis is critical for the development and maintenance of central nervous system (CNS) tissues and a distinct genetic program of cell death occurs in all eukaryotic organisms !!!REF!!!. During the initiation phase of apoptosis, a given death signal activates an intracellular cascade of events that may involve the translocation of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family members to the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial dysfunction follows, with release of cytochrome , production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of caspases !!!REF!!!. An essential component of this intracellular cascade is the activity of the Bcl-2-associated X-protein (BAX). This 21kDa pro-apoptotic molecule has the ability to form homo- and heterodimers with other proteins (e.g. BclxL, Mcl1, A1) that regulate cell death, thereby modulating whether a cell lives or dies in response to different death paradigms !!!REF!!!. Studies of the pathogenic mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration have been particularly valuable in implicating apoptosis in PD and related brain conditions. For instance, increased expression of either intracellular or soluble death signals occurs following oxidative stress in vulnerable dopamine neurons !!!REF!!!. Further, the levels of prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR-4; another death cascade signal) are specifically increased in dopamine cells of the SN !!!REF!!!, and expression of mutant α-synuclein promotes apoptosis in cultured cells !!!REF!!!. These results suggest (but do not prove) that neuronal death by apoptosis underlies, at least some of the clinical symptoms of PD. Here, we have examined the cellular profile of BAX protein in PD with a special emphasis on the distribution and organizational pattern of the above death-promoting molecule within midbrain neurons.  Exposure of tissues to noxious stimuli leads to induction of immediate early gene (IEG) products such as Zif/268 (NGFI-A or KROX-24) and c-Fos in the spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (medullary dorsal horn) !!!REFs!!!. As these proteins are transcription factors, their expression was suggested to play an important role in converting extracellular events such as noxious stimulation into long-term intracellular changes !!!REF!!!. The features of Zif/268 expression in the spinal and medullary dorsal horns are closely similar to that of c-Fos, and the distribution of these proteins roughly corresponds to the sites of central termination of nociceptive primary afferents !!!REFs!!!, suggesting that these afferents play a critical role in the expression of such proteins. Nociceptive primary afferents contain glutamate, an excitatory amino acid !!!REFs!!!, which is released in response to noxious stimulation !!!REFs!!!, and glutamate receptors are abundantly expressed in spinal and medullary dorsal horn neurons !!!REFs!!!. Thus, excitatory synaptic processing associated with glutamate receptors could be involved in the expression of Zif/268 and c-Fos proteins in dorsal horn neurons. Indeed, pretreatment with antagonists of the -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor significantly reduced c-Fos expression in the spinal dorsal horn !!!REFs!!! and trigeminal nucleus caudalis !!!REFs!!! following noxious stimulation. Furthermore, a subunit of NMDA receptors was found to be expressed by some spinal dorsal horn neurons in which c-Fos protein was also induced following noxious stimulation !!!REF!!!. Thus, these previous results suggest an involvement of NMDA receptors in noxious stimulus-evoked c-Fos expression. However, no information is available on the contribution of NMDA receptors to Zif/268 expression, which is also markedly induced by noxious stimulation. Recently, it was demonstrated that topical application of NMDA to the spinal trigeminal tract induces Zif/268 as well as c-Fos expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis !!!REF!!!. This suggests that NMDA receptors may be also involved in Zif/268 expression elicited in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis by noxious stimulation to oro-facial regions. In addition, the co-localization of Zif/268 or c-Fos expression following noxious stimulation and NMDA receptors has not been hitherto examined in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. On this basis, we examined the effect of pretreatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist on Zif/268 expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis following formalin injection into the whisker pad of rats. Furthermore, we examined in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis the co-localization of formalin injection-evoked Zif/268 expression and the subunit 1 of the NMDA receptor 1 (NR1), while comparing these data with c-Fos induction in the same experimental paradigm.  Although the gustatory thalamus (GT; the parvicellular region of the ventral posteromedial nucleus) is a component of the central gustatory system (for reviews see !!!REFs!!!), there is scant indication that it has a role in the detection of, or responsivity to, the immediate sensory properties of gustatory stimuli (for a review see !!!REF!!!). Thus, circumscribed electrolytic lesions or axon-sparing excitotoxic lesions of the GT have little impact on preference-aversion functions as determined with the taste reactivity test or with brief (10s), short (15min), or long (24h) duration procedures (!!!REFs!!!; see also !!!REF!!!). Furthermore, GT-lesioned (GTX) rats can use gustatory stimuli to acquire first-order conditioned flavor preferences as well as conditioned taste aversions (CTAs !!!REFs!!!). Rats with focal lesions of the GT are, however, unable to respond appropriately when taste is used as a cue in more complex gustatory information processing tasks. For example, GTX rats fail to show negative contrast effects based on the memory (successive contrast !!!REFs!!!) or expected arrival (anticipatory contrast !!!REFs!!!) of a high value reward relative to the currently available low value reward. Of particular relevance to present purposes, GTX rats are unable to use a taste stimulus to attenuate or “overshadow” the strength of an acquired aversion to an odor stimulus. Thus, lesioned rats actually acquire a stronger conditioned odor aversion (COA) than neurologically intact subjects following conditioning with an odor–taste compound stimulus !!!REF!!!. The absence of overshadowing raises the possibility that attention to taste cues is disrupted in GTX animals and this attentional deficit, in turn, allows stronger learning to the odor cue than would otherwise occur. The goal of the present study was to test the idea that the absence of overshadowing was the consequence of a lesion-induced disruption of attentional processing. In the CTA paradigm, a taste solution (the conditioned stimulus or CS) is paired with illness (the unconditioned stimulus or US) produced by administration of a nausea-inducing agent such as lithium chloride. The association formed between the CS and US leads to an avoidance of, or a reluctance to consume, that CS when it is encountered in the future (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Using the same procedure, COAs also can be acquired, although they tend to be less robust and more labile than CTAs !!!REFs!!!. Under certain conditions, however, when a taste CS and an odor CS are presented together as a compound CS, the strength of the COA is attenuated relative to the odor aversion that develops in the absence of the taste stimulus (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). This effect, in which the more salient CS acquires greater associative strength than the less salient CS, is termed overshadowing !!!REF!!!. As noted above, Reilly and Pritchard !!!REF!!! found that rats with electrolytic lesions of the GT, which showed normal CTA and COA, were unable to use a taste CS to modulate the strength of a COA. The pattern of normal behaviors obtained in that experiment demonstrates that the absence of overshadowing cannot be attributed to a lesion-induced disruption of the (i) detection of the taste and odor stimuli that constitute the CSs, (ii) detection of the aversive visceral information that constitutes the US, (iii) formation of first-order associations between the neural representations of the CSs and the US, (iv) retrieval of those associations at the time of test, or (v) expression of that knowledge in performance. Rather, the lesion may disrupt the processes that are involved in overshadowing. One class of theories (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) suggests that CSs compete with each other for attention such that the more salient of two CSs will control conditioned responding at the expense of the less salient CS (which therefore might be viewed as redundant). Furthermore, it is proposed that attention to a CS declines if that CS lacks importance (i.e. supplies no new information and thus might be considered irrelevant). Such attentional theories can account for a number of classical conditioning phenomena, including overshadowing. Of particular relevance to the present study, latent inhibition and blocking can be interpreted as a consequence of decremental attentional processing (for an excellent review see !!!REF!!!). Accordingly, the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the GT on latent inhibition and blocking were examined in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, respectively.  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that affects movement, balance, and fine motor control. These impairments are related to the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), with a concomitant reduction of striatal dopamine levels !!!REFs!!!. Animals in which this nigrostriatal pathway has been experimentally destroyed are considered useful preparations for PD study !!!REF!!!. These preparations have clarified the anatomy, neurochemistry, and electrophysiology of DA neurons and their relationships with brain nuclei they innervate and from which they receive innervation. Although the etiology of PD is not known, biochemical data from human brain autopsy studies and from animal models point out to an on going process of oxidative stress in the substantia nigra, which could induce degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons !!!REFs!!!. The nigrostriatal DA pathway consists of the A9 cell group, which is located in the SNc. The axons of these neurons run along the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to reach the dorsal neostriatum (caudate putamen (CPu) nucleus). The neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) have been used in various mammalian species to produce experimental PD. In modeling experimental PD, a major advance came with the introduction of the catecholamine neurotoxin 6-OHDA !!!REF!!!. This molecule is transported into the cell bodies and fibers of both dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons. It causes degeneration of nerve terminals and can affect cell body regions. Microinjection of 6-OHDA into the MFB can cause a total destruction of SNc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons !!!REF!!!. It results in a well-described syndrome that includes: (i) near total depletion of DA in the ipsilateral CPu; (ii) denervation supersensitivity of the postsynaptic DA receptors in the ipsilateral CPu; and (iii) a characteristic functional asymmetry with quantifiable turning behavior, contralateral to injection side in response to the direct DA agonist apomorphine !!!REFs!!!. Because of the extensive loss of DA neurons, PD is often thought as a DA-specific disorder. However, histological studies have demonstrated losses in non-DA cell populations. A further important point regarding PD experimental models is the toxin injection site. Administration of 6-OHDA into the MFB, SNc, or CPu can produce variable results regarding the extent of the lesion and the lesioned pathways !!!REFs!!!. Electrolytic lesion of the substantia nigra will result in apomorphine-induced turning behavior. Although the precise mechanism and neuronal pathways mediating circling behavior in this model remain to be established, it may reflect an imbalance between DA mechanisms !!!REFs!!!. After unilateral DA damage the homologous contralateral anatomical sites would become dominant, with turning behavior developing contralateral to the dominant side. Electrolytic lesions, however, induce non-specific destruction of neuronal and glial cells, as well as connective tissue, in the vicinity to the electrode tip. It may, therefore, destroy other neuronal pathways in addition to the ascending nigrostriatal tract !!!REF!!!. Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived liposoluble molecule, generated from the amino acid l-arginine by a family of enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS) !!!REF!!!. In the central nervous system, a constitutive, calmodulin-dependent NOS, has been located in many brain regions !!!REF!!!. The same cerebral neurons stain for NOS and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) !!!REF!!!, and purified brain NOS has NADPH-d activity !!!REFs!!!. NOS positive cells are found in basal ganglia !!!REF!!!. The function of neuronal NO in basal ganglia circuitry remains unexplored although NO has been shown to increase dopamine release from striatal slices in vitro !!!REFs!!!. In addition, the role of NO as neuroprotector or neurotoxic !!!REFs!!! has been described in the nervous system. This raises the possibility that NO may play a role in control of motor behavior. In agreement with this suggestion, it was recently found that acute administration of G-nitro-l-arginine (l-NOARG), a NOS inhibitor, induced catalepsy in a dose-dependent manner in mice !!!REFs!!!. The drug had an addictive effect with haloperidol and the acute effect of l-NOARG was attenuated by previous treatment with l-arginine. Sub-chronic treatment with l-NOARG was also able to attenuate the cataleptic effect of acute drug administration !!!REF!!!. If NO is involved in neuropathology of neurodegeneration, it would explain why a neuronal NOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7NI), is protective in the MPTP toxin-induced neurodegeneration in mice !!!REF!!!. Mutant mice lacking neuronal NOS are more resistant to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity than their wild-type littermates. 7NI has been shown to prevent the conversion of MPTP to MPP+ !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, controversial results regarding the role of NO in PD also exist. For example, no protection for MPTP toxicity was obtained with l-NAME !!!REFs!!!. Also, Ponzoni et al. !!!REF!!! found that NO synthesis inhibition potentiated manganese chloride lesions of the SNc and reversed the NADPH-d cell number increase induced by lesion. Therefore, the role of NO in PD is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of neuronal NOS and NADPH-d activity in rat brain regions associated with basal ganglia circuitry following electrolytic or 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway.  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been suggested as important mediators in traumatic brain injury, strokes, neurodegenerative diseases and alcohol-induced brain pathology !!!REFs!!!. Apoptosis, often termed as a physiological cell death, is involved in a number of critical events occurring during normal development and maturation and is thought to play key roles in a wide variety of diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders and vascular diseases !!!REFs!!!. Over the past two decades, studies on the pathogenesis of cerebral vascular diseases have concentrated on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) pathology and proliferation. A few recent studies have begun to investigate peripheral VSMCs apoptosis !!!REFs!!!. Vascular diseases are characterized by alterations of blood vessel structure and blood flows mainly determined by VSMCs growth, which is now viewed as the result of the opposing effects of cell proliferation and apoptosis !!!REFs!!!. Apoptosis is a prominent feature of remodeling vascular processes that occur in atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis and stroke !!!REFs!!!. Apoptosis can be initiated by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals, such as cytokines, hormones, and ROS. ROS comprise a group of molecules including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion, singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals !!!REFs!!!. Several recent studies indicate that exogenous oxidants can induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types !!!REFs!!!. Morever, evidence that apoptosis can be triggered by oxidative stress has been provided by studies in which putative mediators of apoptosis have been induced by ROS or inhibited by addition of antioxidants. Thus, some investigators have proposed that oxidative stress could be a mediator of apoptosis common to many different types of trigger mechanisms (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Among a diverse number of ROS, H2O2 plays a key role because it is generated from nearly all sources of oxidative stress and can diffuse freely in and out of cells and tissues !!!REFs!!!. In addition, it has been shown that H2O2 has a dual effect on cell growth by provoking cell proliferation and triggering cell death either via necrosis or apoptosis, depending on the concentration of the oxidant employed and/or the type of cell being studied !!!REFs!!!. Recently, two reports have appeared which suggest that H2O2 can induce apoptosis in human and rat peripheral VSMCs !!!REFs!!!, but no reports have appeared on whether or not H2O2 can induce apoptosis in cerebral vascular muscle cells. The present study was designed to determine whether or not cerebral VSMCs undergo apoptosis following treatment with H2O2, and whether the process can occur in a concentration-dependent manner.  The central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system communicate with each other in a bidirectional fashion !!!REFs!!!. It has been known for sometime that interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a cytokine produced by activated monocytes, macrophages, and a host of other specialized cells in the body, affects important functions in the nervous and endocrine systems !!!REF!!!. It produces a number of central effects such as fever, sleep, anorexia, and analgesia !!!REFs!!!. The neuroendocrine effects of IL-1β include activation of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, inhibition of hypothalamo–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, etc. !!!REFs!!!. Chronic treatment with IL-1β is known to affect many of the above-mentioned functions. Although food intake decreases initially after IL treatment, repeated exposure to IL elicits an adaptive response in this function with the animal regaining its feeding capabilities within a few days !!!REF!!!. A similar response has been observed with fever production and serum corticosterone levels !!!REFs!!!. The mechanism by which this effect is brought about is unclear. We have previously observed changes in brain neurotransmitters in specific areas of the hypothalamus after a single injection of IL-1β !!!REFs!!!. More specifically, we observed increases in the levels of norepinephrine (NE) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus that contain respectively the cell bodies and terminals of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons !!!REF!!!. An increase in NE levels in these areas is crucial for the activation of the HPA axis and the orchestration of effects such as anorexia and fever production !!!REFs!!!. Since chronic IL treatment is capable of producing an adaptive response in these functions, we wanted to examine NE activity in these two hypothalamic nuclei and compare it to the effects of chronic IL on feeding, body temperature and HPA activation. For this purpose, rats were subjected to acute and chronic treatment with IL-1β. NE concentrations in specific areas of the brain were measured using Palkovits’ microdissection and HPLC-EC. The effects of chronic IL on brain norepinephrine were compared to its effects on feeding, body weight gain, rectal temperature and serum corticosterone.  The examination of immediate early gene (IEG) expression has proven to be a powerful tool for exploring the effects of dopaminergic drugs on the striatum. One of the major results obtained using these methods is the observation that the indirect dopamine agonist amphetamine induces pronounced Fos expression in the rostral striatum which is distributed in an extremely patchy pattern !!!REFs!!!. The patches of intense Fos expression correspond precisely to the calbindin poor striosomal compartment !!!REFs!!!, with much less staining being present in the intervening matrix regions. These two striatal regions differ from each other in terms of their embryology, neurochemistry and anatomical connectivity !!!REFs!!! and these studies of Fos expression suggest that they also differ in the way in which they respond to amphetamine treatment. Similar results have been reported for other IEGs, including Zif/268 !!!REF!!! and the activity regulated cytoskeletal protein Arc !!!REF!!!, and can also be observed after treatment with a number of other pharmacologically related drugs, such as the nonselective dopamine agonist apomorphine !!!REFs!!!. Other results have indicated that the ability of various dopaminergic treatments to induce stereotypic behavior is correlated with the extent to which these treatments induce patchy patterns of Fos expression !!!REFs!!!. These findings suggest that patterning of IEG expression may have important correlates even at the behavioral level and that understanding the mechanisms underlying the distribution of IEGs within the striatum may shed light on the functional organization of this structure. It is likely that interactions between D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors play a critical role in the induction of striatal IEG expression. D2-like agonists by themselves do not induce striatal IEG expression !!!REFs!!! and, under some conditions, may actually suppress it !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, full D1 agonists like A77636 !!!REFs!!! or SKF-82958 !!!REFs!!! are able to induce pronounced expression of c-Fos throughout the rostral striatum of normal rats and primates and similar effects are produced by the partial D1 agonist SKF-38393 in dopamine depleted animals !!!REFs!!!. Unlike the patchy staining seen after amphetamine, however, the response to selective D1 agonists is relatively homogenous. In contrast, combined administration of D1 and D2 agonists, under a number of different experimental conditions, results in a patchy pattern of IEG expression !!!REFs!!!, an effect which could not be predicted from the response to either of the agents in isolation. These findings suggest that pharmacological activation of D2 dopamine receptors plays a critical role in the induction of patchy staining patterns following treatment with combinations of direct D1 and D2 agonists. Since amphetamine would be expected to stimulate both D1 and D2 receptors, the considerations discussed above suggest that D2 receptors may be critically involved in the patchy nature of the IEG expression induced by this drug. The obvious way to approach this question is to examine whether selective D2 antagonists are able to alter the distribution of IEGs following amphetamine administration. This approach, however, is complicated by the fact that D2 antagonists, by themselves, induce intense IEG expression which might mask or obscure the pattern of the response to amphetamine. In the current study we attempted to avoid this difficulty by examining the effect of D2 blockade on the expression of the IEGs c-Fos and Arc in animals which had been pretreated with reserpine. Since the IEG response to dopamine antagonists is the result of an acute reduction in D2 receptor-mediated events, these drugs would be expected to have little further effect in animals in which dopaminergic transmission has been drastically disrupted by reserpine, which blocks the impulse-dependent release of dopamine !!!REF!!!. Reserpine does not, however, deplete the newly synthesized pool from which amphetamine releases dopamine, and thus does not prevent amphetamine from inducing either behavioral activation !!!REF!!! or IEG expression !!!REFs!!!. It is of especial interest for the current study that reserpine pretreatment also does not appear to disrupt the ability of amphetamine to induce the characteristic patchy staining pattern !!!REF!!!.  Part of the experimental research on aging has focused on relationships between memory deficits and basal forebrain dysfunctions (e.g. !!!REF!!!). The medial septum (MS), the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) are cholinergic nuclei of this brain region, which innervate the hippocampus (MS and DBB) or the neocortex (NBM). In animals, all these systems are involved in cognitive functions (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) and may undergo age-related alterations (e.g. !!!REF!!!). Like humans, aged rats also present impairments in learning and memory tasks (e.g. !!!REF!!!) and—again like in humans—this impairment is known to be heterogeneous within a given population (e.g. !!!REF!!!), suggesting differential levels of alteration in the brain. The neurobiological basis of the latter is still unclear. In a recent study !!!REF!!!, using a superfusion technique of hippocampus slices with electrical field stimulations, as was done in previous work (e.g. !!!REF!!!), we found that aged rats (25–27 months) exhibited a reduced accumulation of [!!!MATH!!!]choline and [!!!MATH!!!]serotonin ([!!!MATH!!!]5-HT), an increased accumulation of [!!!MATH!!!]noradrenaline ([!!!MATH!!!]NA), and a weaker evoked overflow of both [!!!MATH!!!]acetylcholine ([!!!MATH!!!]ACh) and [!!!MATH!!!]5-HT, as compared to young adults (3–5 months). The nicotine-evoked overflow of [!!!MATH!!!]NA was not altered consistently by aging. In hippocampal homogenates, the activity of ChAT or AChE, as well as the concentration of 5-HT were not significantly altered in aged rats; the concentration of NA was reduced. However, when significant, these age-related changes showed no relationship with the level of spatial reference-memory impairments assessed in a water maze. The present study re-examined the evoked overflow of acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in hippocampal slices from another set of aged rats, but used application of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), a potassium channel antagonist, that evokes transmitter release by increasing the spontaneous neuronal activity. Compared to electrical stimulation, 3,4-DAP application therefore more closely mimics the physiological mechanisms of terminal depolarization !!!REF!!! and may also reflect age-related changes in presynaptic K+ channel density and neuronal excitability. Using this method in a previous study, we were able to demonstrate neuropharmacological modulatory mechanisms that could not be shown when the overflow was elicited electrically !!!REFs!!!. We therefore expected to be able to assess more subtle age-related changes, which may have been overshadowed by the electrical stimulation in our previous study. In part of the slices incubated in the presence of [!!!MATH!!!]NA, we also measured the overflow of [!!!MATH!!!] elicited by stimulation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors on noradrenergic axon terminals.  During much of sleep, neurons in the cerebral cortex fire and stop firing together in waves of activity having frequencies of less than 4.5Hz. Such slow-wave activity, which is the most pronounced electroencephalographic (EEG) feature of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, is also a reliable predictor of sleep intensity. An important feature of slow-wave activity during sleep is that it increases as a function of previous wakefulness, and it gradually decreases in the course of sleep !!!REF!!!. This homeostatic regulation suggests that slow-wave activity may be linked to some restorative aspect of sleep. However, the mechanisms and functions of slow-wave homeostasis are still unclear. Here we discuss a hypothesis that links sleep with synaptic homeostasis. The hypothesis is as follows: We discuss each of its four points in sequence. Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation in several cortical circuits; Synaptic potentiation is tied to the homeostatic regulation of slow-wave activity; Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic downscaling; Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep on performance.  Several clinical trials have been initiated to assess effectiveness of treatments for Huntington’s disease (HD) !!!REFs!!!. It is expected that the number of clinical trials will increase rapidly over the next few years as the result of insights into the pathogenesis and development of new methods for quickly screening potential treatments. Outcome measures in such trials generally involve assessment of severity of neurological abnormalities or alteration in functional capacity, with rating scales such as the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) !!!REF!!! or Total Functional Capacity (TFC) !!!REF!!! Scale. This pilot study evaluates the potential usefulness of a neurobiologic marker of disease progression, volume of the caudate nucleus, as measured on MRI scans. Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated high correlations between caudate volume and severity of HD symptoms !!!REFs!!!. Significant longitudinal change in caudate volume has been documented in MRI studies over relatively short periods of time in both symptomatic patients and presymptomatic individuals who carry the gene mutation of HD !!!REFs!!!. The primary aim of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of using caudate volume as an outcome measure in future clinical trials by measuring change in this structure in a standardized manner in a subgroup of clinical trial participants.   Acupuncture has been used as a therapeutic treatment for various kinds of pain, including lower back pain, chronic elbow pain, myofascial pain, toothache, etc. !!!REFs!!!. It has been suggested that endogenous opioid or descending inhibitory pathways mediate the analgesic effect of acupuncture in the central nervous system (CNS) !!!REF!!!. However, the analgesic effects in the rat responding to electroacupuncture (EA) show marked individual variations. Up to 40% of Sprague–Dawley rats were not respondent to EA in a previous study !!!REF!!!. One of the possible mechanisms acting in the non-responder (low effect) to EA analgesia may be related to increased release of cholecystokinin (CCK)-8 in the CNS. CCK is a gut-brain peptide that exerts a variety of physiological actions in the gastrointestinal tract and the CNS through the cell surface CCK receptors !!!REFs!!!. It has been reported that there are two subtypes of CCK receptors, CCK-A and CCK-B !!!REF!!!. In addition, CCK-8 is known to be one of the most potent endogenous anti-opioid peptide available today !!!REFs!!!. Although there is some controversy, it is widely accepted that the amount of CCK-8 released makes such individual variations at least in the rats !!!REFs!!!. Arrays of physiological functions have been attributed to central CCK-8, among which the antagonistic effect on opioid analgesia has been defined by behavioral and electrophysiological studies !!!REFs!!!. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby CCK-8 exerts its anti-opioid effect remain still obscure. In the previous study, we showed that CCK-A receptors are significantly more expressed in the non-responder than those in the responder group in the hypothalamus, whereas CCK-B receptor expression is similar in both groups !!!REF!!!. In order to prove the possible connection between CCK-A receptor expression and the responsiveness of EA analgesic effects in vivo, Otsuka Long–Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were used in this study. OLETF rats are CCK-A receptor knockout rats bred at the Tokushima Research Institute (Ostuka Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan) !!!REF!!!. This strain has a 6847 base pair deletion of the CCK-A receptor gene in which the promoter and the first two exons are missing !!!REF!!!. And the expression of cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor gene was not detected in stomach, pancreas, and brain by the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blotting of the PCR products in OLETF rats !!!REF!!!, while the CCK B receptor is unaffected !!!REF!!!. By taking advantage of using OLETF rats, we investigated the relationship between CCK receptors expression and EA-mediated analgesic effects in vivo.  The water maze has been used to study sex differences in spatial learning, employing different species of animals including voles, mice and rats. For example, 6 months old Long Evans rats, tested on the water maze, did not display any sex difference in spatial learning !!!REF!!!. However, there are also studies showing a male advantage in performance in spatial mazes and specifically in the water maze (for a review, see !!!REF!!!). Performance on cognitive tasks is not only affected by differences in cognitive ability, but also by cognitive style or behavioral strategy. Furthermore, cognitive strategy can be influenced by various factors including pharmacological manipulations, age or hormones in addition to sex !!!REF!!!. However, in the aforementioned “spatial learning” water maze studies !!!REF!!! the focus is on the learning of platform position when the platform is hidden (below the surface of opaque water) and detectable only through the use of extra-maze cues (a form of conceptual learning). The visible-platform condition (platform above the water surface) also constitutes platform-position learning, but this form of perceptual learning is generally not assessed. It is, therefore, not possible to independently assess cognitive conceptual versus perceptual abilities. Nor is it easy to draw the distinction between cognitive ability and style. In a modified version of the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task that was first introduced by McDonald and White !!!REF!!! and subsequently adapted by us !!!REF!!!, the rat’s ability to find the platform [escape latency (EL)] was assessed for 12 days, with the platform, always in the same place, being visible on days 1–3, 5–7, and 9–11, and hidden on the remaining days. As detailed in Kanit et al. !!!REF!!!, the visible condition requires perceptual, “look-out” strategy for learning (i.e. a decrease of escape latency over trials) to occur, whereas the hidden condition requires conceptual, “navigational” cognitive strategy. If, as occurred in studies by Kanit et al. !!!REFs!!!, both the visible and hidden tasks show evidence of acquisition (i.e. both perceptual and conceptual cognitive ability), but no group (e.g. sex, nicotine treatment, age, hormonal manipulations) differences during the 12 days of acquisition, then any group differences that do emerge when the rats are subsequently challenged by a new cognitive task on the 13th day (platform position shifted and the platform made visible) can be interpreted to be due to group differences in cognitive styles. Although only the platform in the new place provides escape, initially the rats do not have that information and therefore the first trial of the shift task can be assumed to present a choice for the rats. There are various factors that may influence the rat’s choice such as looking around to see the newly positioned visible platform, calculating the distance to the platforms, and motivation to try “novelty.” When presented with the choice of the 13th day, rats display a very significant sex difference in trying to escape, and specifically when, on the first trial of the 13th day, the new position of the platform is closer or to the starting position of the rat compared to the previously learned, location. While male rats perseverate and continue swimming to search for the platform in its “old” location, female rats immediately swim to the newly positioned platform (visible) with ELs around 1s !!!REFs!!!. We have called this sexually dimorphic cognitive style phenomenon the proximal perceptual style effect, because minimal ELs depend on the rat choosing present perceptual knowledge (about the newly located platform) over past conceptual knowledge (about where the platform used to be). Since rats do not display any ability difference that should have affected performance during the acquisition phase of the experiment, this sexually dimorphic behavior on day 13 can be interpreted as a difference in cognitive style or behavioral strategy. Furthermore, this female-type strategy is abolished by nicotine !!!REF!!!, does not emerge before puberty !!!REF!!! and is not affected by ovariectomy (in sexually mature rats) and/or hormone replacement (estrogen, progesterone or both) !!!REF!!!. Finally, post-experimental measurements of brain nitric oxide (NO) metabolites !!!REFs!!! suggest that NO may underlie the sexually dimorphic cognitive strategies that rats employ in the solution of the 13th day, shifted-platform-position water maze task. Specifically, we have found a significant negative correlation between cortical NO2 −+NO3 − levels and female-preferred strategy in a study where all other correlations we looked at, including that between hippocampal NO2 −+NO3 − levels, and the female-preferred strategy, were not significant !!!REF!!!. NO is implicated in animal cognitive performance !!!REFs!!!. In addition, there is an impressive amount of evidence suggesting the involvement of NO in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), synaptic plasticity, and consequently learning and memory. While some studies report impairment of spatial learning by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition !!!REFs!!!, Bannerman et al. !!!REF!!! suggest that the observed impairment in spatial learning following NOS inhibition is actually secondary to impairment of acquisition. NO appears to show sex differences in some brain areas and not in others. Specifically, male Sprague–Dawley rats have significantly higher NO2 −+NO3 − levels (stable metabolites of NO) than females in the cortex and hippocampus, but no sex differences are observed in the cerebellum, midbrain and corpus striatum !!!REF!!!. We have shown that nicotine eliminates the sex difference in strategies used for problem solving, and shifts the female pattern to that of the male !!!REF!!!. We have also demonstrated the biobehavioral connection between cortical NO and sexually dimorphic behavior in the WM !!!REF!!!. Recent studies point to NO involvement in some of the central effects of nicotine. Nicotine increases levels of the metabolites, and therefore presumably of NO, with sex differences in the degree of stimulation, the brain regions affected, and the duration (acute versus chronic) of nicotine administration !!!REFs!!!. It is therefore likely that NO is involved in the central effects of nicotine. Yilmaz et al. have shown that the beneficial effect of nicotine on performance in an active avoidance test disappears when rats are treated with a NOS inhibitor before testing !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of NOS inhibition on cognitive ability and behavioral strategy used for the solution of a place-learning problem in rats and to evaluate possible sex differences in this involvement. Since earlier studies pointed to a sex difference in the effect of nicotine (which elevates NO levels) and a negative correlation between cortical NO and female cognitive style, we hypothesized that NOS inhibition may induce the female-preferred strategy in male rats.  Cytokines are potent, multifunctional, pleiotropic proteins that have been initially characterized in the context of cellular activation and cellular communication in the immune system. The first direct evidence of the presence and activity of cytokines in the brain was obtained two decades ago and regarded interleukin (IL)-1β in humans and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the rat brain !!!REFs!!!. Cytokines are present in several brain structures and cellular types, e.g. glia, neurons, and macrophages, in form of proteins and their receptors !!!REFs!!!. Besides their well characterized role in mediating the central components of the host innate immune response, convergent findings point to a direct or indirect role for cytokines in stress-related disorders, including depression !!!REFs!!!: (i) cytokines administered to patients and laboratory animals induce symptoms of depression !!!REFs!!!; (ii) exposure to acute stressors can induce the expression of cytokines at the periphery and in the brain (e.g. !!!REF!!!); (iii) somatic disorders with an inflammatory component are associated with a high prevalence of depressive disorders and cytokines imbalance !!!REF!!!. Because of their potent activatory effect on the HPA axis, proinflammatory cytokines could contribute to the elevated levels of glucocorticoids that are observed in depressed patients !!!REFs!!!. Reciprocally, activation of glucocorticoid receptors leads to down regulation of peripheral and central expression of proinflammatory cytokines, via modulation of AP-1 and NFkB transcription !!!REF!!!. Accordingly, it has been suggested that glucocorticoids and central/peripheral cytokines are finely balanced to maintain homeostasis with reciprocal inhibitory/activatory pathways being present !!!REFs!!!. This complex balance appears critical and, if not maintained, it can have clinical consequences in the form for instance of neuronal death or reduced brain plasticity !!!REFs!!!. Conventional models of stress in laboratory rodents, however, show little face validity with the chronic human psychopathologies. Models of social stress based on the naturalistic events of interactions between conspecifics offer a realistic tool to induce chronic stress in animal models !!!REF!!!. In recent years we developed a naturalistic and ethologically-oriented model of chronic psychosocial stress, which is based on a natural behavior of male mice, i.e. acquiring and defending a territory. When forcing two adult males in a chronic sensory contact and with a brief daily agonistic encounter, mice seem to live under a constant threat and activation !!!REFs!!!. From previous investigations it becomes evident that social status and territory ownership are factors determining the vulnerability to chronic stress exposure. This seem true for behavioral, autonomic, metabolic and immune functions, but not for the regulation of the HPA axis. Indeed all animals under chronic stress showed high corticosterone both in basal condition and after dexamethasone challenge. Given the key regulatory role of corticosterone on cytokines expression !!!REF!!!, our aim was to investigate whether subjecting male mice to such a naturalistic stressor would result in a modulation of the central cytokines network (IL-1β, IL-1Ra, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10) and glucocorticoids receptors (GR) in basal conditions (e.g. !!!REF!!!), i.e. in absence of any further acute stressor such as restraint stress or lypopolisaccaride (LPS) injection (e.g. !!!REF!!!).  It has been established that the longitudinal columns of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), along its rostrocaudal axis, coordinate distinct patterns of behavioral and physiological reactions critical for survival !!!REFs!!!. Electrical or chemical stimulation of the dorsal half of the periaqueductal gray of the rat leads to a vigorous defensive response characterized by alertness, freezing and escape behavior !!!REFs!!!. Although escape behavior has been the main focus of attention, interest in freezing behavior induced by electrical stimulation of the dlPAG has grown lately. This freezing behavior is not mediated by ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), as it is not changed by vlPAG electrolytic lesions !!!REF!!!. It is, thus, logical to assume that other PAG afferents and efferents should mediate this reaction !!!REF!!!. Indeed, freezing behavior elicited by this procedure has been reported to resemble human panic attacks !!!REF!!!. The structures with higher chance of being involved in the neural circuits of aversion are also those that when electrically stimulated, rostrally to the PAG, also give rise to defensive responses, such as the amygdala and medial hypothalamus, and the cuneiform nucleus, more caudally !!!REFs!!!. The medial frontal and cingulate cortices, sources of afferents to PAG, have also been implicated in the mediation of affective responses !!!REFs!!!. In fact, all these structures show increased Fos expression when rats are submitted to anxiogenic procedures !!!REFs!!!. Defensive strategies as distinct as avoidance, freezing and escape are likely to be organized by different networks !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it is expected that electrical stimulation of the dlPAG either at freezing or escape thresholds should activate different sets of brain structures. To test this prediction Fos distribution was presently measured in serial sections of the brain following dlPAG electrical stimulations at freezing and escape thresholds of rats placed in an arena. Sham-stimulated animals were exposed to the same procedure in order to control for novelty of the exposure and locomotor activity. The reason for choosing electrical stimulation in this work is that this procedure makes it possible to clearly dissociate freezing and escape responses with gradual increases in the intensity of the electrical stimulation of the dlPAG. Also, we have chosen to concentrate on those nuclei known for having monosynaptic connections with PAG; that is, cingulate (Cg) and prelimbic (PrL) areas !!!REF!!!, central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) !!!REF!!!, ventromedial (dorsomedial part, VMHdm) and premammillary (PMd) nuclei of the hypothalamus !!!REF!!!, cuneiform nucleus (CnF) !!!REF!!!, inferior colliculus (IC) !!!REF!!!, the locus coeruleus (LC) !!!REF!!! and of course the dorsomedial (dmPAG), dorsolateral (dlPAG), lateral (lPAG) and ventrolateral (vlPAG) subdivisions of periaqueductal gray !!!REFs!!!. Microinjections of GABA receptor antagonists, such as bicuculline, into the dlPAG cause escape interspersed with freezing behavior. These effects have been related to the release of the tonic inhibition exerted by GABA mechanisms on the efferents responsible for the defense reaction !!!REFs!!!. For comparison purposes with the electrical stimulation, which stimulates fibers of passage and does not distinguish between efferents from and afferents to the region under study, chemical stimulation of the dlPAG with bicuculline, which activates only post-synaptic neurons, was also performed in this work.  β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates are toxic on neurons !!!REF!!!. Aβ fibrils interact also with microglial cells and monocytes and stimulate expression of proinflammatory genes !!!REF!!!. There is a need for an easy and reliable method for measuring the toxic effects of Aβ peptides and similar toxic polypeptide aggregates (e.g. prion peptides, amylin, etc.). The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay has been widely used to measure the toxicity of different substances in cell cultures !!!REF!!!. MTT enters the cells by endocytosis and is reduced to formazan by NADH reductase and other enzymes, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. All subcellular fractions can reduce MTT when supplied with NADH or NADPH. The amount of formazan reflects the reductive potential of the cytoplasm and the cell viability !!!REF!!!. This method has proven to be very useful in neurotoxicity studies of Aβ peptides !!!REF!!!. In most cases, neuroblastoma cells, e.g. SH-SY5Y, are applied !!!REF!!!. The MTT assay is rapid and generally shows a good correlation with other viability tests !!!REFs!!! and in vivo results !!!REFs!!!. The neurotoxicity of Aβ-peptides (Aβ 1–42 and Aβ 25–35) has been determined with the MTT assay on PC-12 !!!REF!!!, C 1300 !!!REF!!! and SH-SY5Y !!!REF!!! cells. Mostly non-differentiated neuroblastoma cells have been used in the MTT assay. Aβ and other aggregated peptides (prions and human amylin) exert a toxic effect by inducing apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells !!!REFs!!!. Working with non-differentiated cells involves some disadvantages. The number of cells is continuously growing during the experiments (e.g. Aβ-treatment for 24 or 48h), so the results of MTT assay ought to be corrected. Yankner et al. !!!REF!!! reported in 1990 that Aβ-peptides were neurotrophic to undifferentiated neurons and neurotoxic to mature neurons. In cultures, the cells are unsynchronized, which means uncertainty in toxicity measurements. The MTT assay of Aβ-peptides might lead to false results when non-differentiated neuroblastoma cells are used, because Aβ-peptides act mostly on the neurites of the neuroblastoma cells !!!REFs!!!. This was our experience, too. Cell membrane proteins (receptors) play a key role in the events that lead to apoptotic cell death after Aβ treatment. Cell surface receptor complexes are mediating the cellular effects of Aβ peptides !!!REF!!! and the membrane composition of differentiated and non-differentiated cells are different. As a consequence, we have now attempted to improve the weak points of the MTT method by using differentiated cells. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with all--retinoic acid (RA); the resulting differentiated cell culture was used for neurotoxicity studies !!!REF!!!. Our aim was to find a reliable in vitro assay for neurotoxicity measurements, an MTT assay characterized with two improvements: (1) use of highly differentiated neuroblastoma cells which are (morphologically and physiologically) very close to neurons, (2) use of constant cell number during the whole experiment; in this case the redox activity of the cells is directly proportional to the neurotoxicity of the substances and no correction of the results is needed. We wanted to find a method generally suitable for measurements of neurotoxicity of very different aggregating peptides like β-amyloids, prion sequences and human amylin.   Ethanol, through its actions on the central nervous system, is known to produce a large variety of behavioral effects in rodents. In mice, ethanol has biphasic effects on motor activity, showing either stimulant or suppressant effects that depend upon the dose and the time course of the drug !!!REFs!!!. Behavioral stimulation is usually reported to be greater at lower doses, while sedation effects are greater at higher doses !!!REFs!!!. For example, acute IP administration of low doses of ethanol was shown to enhance locomotion in mice !!!REFs!!!. Conversely, when ethanol was administered in higher doses, it induced locomotor suppression, motor incoordination and loss of the righting reflex !!!REFs!!!. Although locomotor activation often is reported to occur after systemic administration of low doses of ethanol in mice, peripheral injections of ethanol in rats generally produce a monophasic suppression of locomotor activity !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, in recent studies we have demonstrated that intraventricular (ICV) infusions of low doses of ethanol in rats can induce signs of behavioral activation, such as increases in operant responding on schedules that generate low baseline rates !!!REFs!!!. The present studies were undertaken to investigate the effects of ICV administration of ethanol on locomotor activity in rats. It has been postulated that a number of the central effects of ethanol are mediated through the ethanol metabolites acetaldehyde and acetate. The oxidative metabolism of ethanol into acetaldehyde takes place in several organs, and can involve multiple enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P450 2E1, and catalase !!!REFs!!!. Acetaldehyde is then metabolized mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into acetic acid. Although ethanol and peripherally produced acetate reach the brain in significant amounts, the presence of acetaldehyde in the brain after moderate levels of ethanol intake is a topic of some controversy !!!REFs!!!. Acetaldehyde derived from the peripheral metabolism of ethanol penetrates from blood to brain with difficulty because of the metabolic barrier presented by ALDH !!!REF!!!, and the isoenzyme of ADH that is largely responsible for hepatic degradation of ethanol is not present in the brain. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that acetaldehyde is formed directly in the brain in part via the enzyme catalase !!!REFs!!!. Several studies have shown that rodents with different sensitivities to ethanol, or distinct patterns of ethanol-related behaviors, have different levels of catalase !!!REFs!!! or ALDH !!!REF!!!, thus supporting the idea that acetaldehyde or acetate are, in part, responsible for the effects of ethanol !!!REFs!!!. Considerable evidence indicates that brain catalase is involved in ethanol-induced changes in locomotor activity. Rodents treated with catalase inhibitors, and acatalasemic mice, have lower ethanol-induced locomotion than control animals !!!REFs!!!. Conversely, substances that enhance brain catalase activity increase ethanol-induced locomotor activity !!!REFs!!!. The changes observed in the behavioral effects of ethanol after the modification of brain catalase activity are bidirectional, and there is a high positive correlation between locomotor activity and brain catalase activity across a wide variety of manipulations !!!REFs!!!. These studies support the proposed role of brain catalase, and thus, acetaldehyde formed in the brain, in ethanol-induced locomotion in mice !!!REFs!!!. The putative central oxidation of ethanol may have important biological implications, and more strategies are needed in order to demonstrate the contribution of acetaldehyde and acetate to the effects of ethanol. In this regard, behavioral studies of the direct effects of acetaldehyde or acetate are of critical importance. Acetaldehyde can produce behavioral effects that are similar to those induced by ethanol, including voluntary self-administration, conditioned stimulus and place preference effects, and conditioned taste aversion !!!REFs!!!. In rats it has been shown that IP acetaldehyde decreases locomotion and rearing in an open field !!!REF!!!. It has also been suggested that peripheral administration of acetate can mimic some of the motor suppressant effects of ethanol !!!REFs!!!. The present work employed tests of open field motor activity to assess the effects of ICV administration of ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate in rats. The central administration of these substances avoids the issue of brain penetrability, and therefore more directly assesses the intracerebral actions of ethanol and ethanol metabolites on different aspects of locomotion. These studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that ICV administration of ethanol could increase locomotion in rats, and to determine if acetaldehyde and acetate are active metabolites of ethanol that are potentially involved in the locomotor effects of this drug. In addition to recording total locomotor activity, we also distinguished between the activity that occurred in the peripheral and central portions of the open field. Typically rats tend to prefer the peripheral sections of an open field, which are adjacent to the walls (i.e., thygmotaxis), and evidence indicates that the anxiolytic effects of some drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) can be assessed in part by measuring the relative amount of interior activity induced by the drug !!!REF!!!.  The question whether psychological interventions can benefit health by influencing immune function !!!REFs!!! is arguably best understood in the context of psychological stress. Stress, according to the pioneering endocrinologist Hans Selye, is “the non-specific response of the body to any demand” !!!REF!!!. His General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) specified three phases of stress: (1) an alarm reaction to marshal resources; (2) a stage of resistance when resistance to stress rises above normal; and (3) a stage of exhaustion when adaptation energy has been consumed !!!REF!!!. This roughly equates to a two-stage model of stress classifying reactions to stressors as in contrast to or . Acute, momentary or short-lasting stress can be defined as the stress that falls in the period between alarm reaction and resistance in Selye’s model. Sustained or chronic stress is the period from resistance to exhaustion. The perception by the subject of the significance of the “stressor” !!!REF!!! is now recognised as essential when the word ‘stress’ can mean either the stressor or its perception !!!REF!!!. Stress perception is thought to be influenced by two capacities of appraisal !!!REF!!!, which can be modified by psychological interventions. Primary appraisal is the perception of the threat or demand in the situation, i.e. ranging from irrelevant or minor through to stressful. Secondary appraisal is the evaluation of one’s ability to cope with the threat or demand. Stress has deleterious effects on health in many organ systems including the immune system. The immune system is closely aligned with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and recently has been shown to interact closely with other systems as well, especially the central nervous and endocrinological systems !!!REF!!!. Evidence shows that there are bi-directional influences between the brain and the immune system with two major pathways—Sympathetic Adrenal Modulation !!!REF!!! and the Hypothalamus–Pituitary–Adrenal axis !!!REF!!!. These involve soluble mediators such as cytokines and hormones !!!REFs!!!. Clearly effects on immune parameters will be complex because these pathways dynamically interact with each other and with various homeostatic controls through regulatory !!!REF!!!, buffering !!!REF!!! and feedback mechanisms !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, effects may vary depending on whether stress is acute or chronic. Many aspects of the immune system are reported to be altered by stress in healthy individuals, including T lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells (NK cells). In particular NK cells have been shown to be reduced by sustained stress !!!REF!!! in both number and in functional activity, and these two measures have been found to be correlated !!!REF!!!. As part of the stress response, CD3+CD8+ T cell counts can also decrease in parallel with CD3−CD56+ NK cells !!!REF!!!, while reports vary as to the effects of stress on CD3+CD4+ T cell counts: increased in chronic stress associated with burnout in nurses !!!REF!!! or little change with the stress of exams in students !!!REF!!!. Acute stress has been mainly examined in experimental settings in the laboratory using short-lasting anxiety reactions coupled with tasks such as mental arithmetic !!!REFs!!! and public speaking !!!REF!!!. Sustained stress reactions have often been examined in healthy populations using academic examinations as the stressor !!!REFs!!!. Among stress intervention techniques one approach has involved the use of self-hypnosis, which overall has shown considerable benefits in buffering the effects of stress that were manifested in control groups !!!REFs!!!. Hypnosis has been widely used in clinical studies involving health and immune function parameters !!!REFs!!!, and it is arguably one of the more accepted therapies within complementary medicine !!!REF!!!. Self-hypnosis will be applied in the present study along with a Japanese laying on of hands method known as Johrei, or ‘purification’, where the participant acts as both the practitioner, who concentrates on the transmission of subtle energies through the hand via the metaphor of light, and the recipient, who in turn visualises images of light received. Young and healthy students facing the stress of exams were chosen to examine the effects of self-hypnosis and Johrei. For comparison purposes, a relaxation technique involving mock neurofeedback was chosen for the control group, a procedure which has been shown to provide a valid relaxation experience !!!REF!!!. By controlling for expectations when the outcome of one intervention is compared with another, the placebo effect is effectively controlled. Similarly as there is a relaxation component present in the mock neurofeedback technique as well as in self-hypnosis and Johrei, relaxation is also effectively controlled. These two aspects of the control condition, expectation and relaxation, enable a stringent test to be made for self-hypnosis and Johrei stress reduction practices. The effects of these psychological interventions on mood have been published elsewhere !!!REF!!!. In brief, both self-hypnosis and Johrei were successful in countering some of the emotional distress of examinations in contrast to the control mock neurofeedback relaxation condition. These advantages were unrelated to expectations about outcome before or after training.  Vestibular receptors located in the inner ear detect linear and angular acceleration of the head, allowing the CNS to monitor head position with respect to gravity (G), and the direction and velocity of head movements !!!REF!!!. Vestibular signals play a prominent role in controlling the activity of the extrinsic eye muscles as well as of the axial and limb muscles, which stabilize eye and body positions during head movements, thus maintaining posture and equilibrium !!!REF!!!. During space flight, exposure to microgravity causes alterations in postural, oculomotor and locomotor functions and possibly changes in gain of the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) !!!REFs!!!. Adaptation of astronauts to microgravity usually occurs within 1 week and a subsequent readaptation period of several months is often required upon return to earth !!!REFs!!!. The specific brain structures affected by changes in gravity force, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for adaptation to ∼0G and readaptation to 1G are largely unknown. Regulation of gene expression is likely to be critically involved in these adaptive processes. All classical excitatory neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, but not inhibitory ones like GABA !!!REF!!!, have been demonstrated to induce immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the brain. Some of these genes, such as Fos and Fos-related antigens (FRAs), encode for transcription factors that control the expression of several target genes !!!REFs!!!. Since these genes regulate cellular functions !!!REF!!!, the induction of Fos and FRA proteins may represent a mechanism by which signals at the cellular membrane are transduced into molecular changes that may potentially mediate neuronal responses during and after space flight. Fos levels peak within 2–4h after stimulus exposure and return to baseline values within 6–8h. FRA levels, on the other hand, peak later and persist in the brain for days or weeks after the initial stimulus !!!REF!!!. Fos and FRAs can thus indicate, and may directly contribute to, short-lasting and long-lasting regulation of brain function, respectively. Several observations suggest that corticocerebellar areas are involved in the adaptation to changes in gravity force. The cerebellar anterior vermis and the flocculonodular lobe (spinocerebellum and vestibulocerebellum, respectively) receive somatosensory and vestibular signals from both macular and canal receptors and project to the vestibular nuclei (VN). The cerebellar anterior vermis sends direct afferents to the lateral VN (whose descending pathway contributes to the VSR) and the flocculonodular lobe projects mainly to the superior and medial vestibular nuclei (whose efferent pathways contribute to the VOR and the vestibulo-collic reflex) !!!REFs!!!. Different cortico-cerebellar areas exert important influences on the gain regulation of the vestibular reflexes !!!REFs!!! and the adaptive processes of the VOR !!!REF!!! and VSR !!!REF!!! during combined visuo-vestibular and neck-vestibular stimulation. The plastic changes occurring in these conditions at the level of the Purkinje cells appear to result from interactions between mossy fiber (MF) and climbing fiber (CF) signals converging on the same corticocerebellar neurons !!!REF!!!. Changes in IEG expression contribute to the long-term desensitization affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells during conjunctive stimulation of CF and MF afferents !!!REFs!!!. This is the basis of the long-term depression involved in the adaptation of the vestibular reflexes !!!REF!!!. We previously studied Fos and FRA expression in rat brainstem vestibular and reticular structures during the NASA Neurolab Mission (STS-90) !!!REF!!!. An increase in Fos and FRA expression was seen in the superior, medial and spinal VN when the gravity force increased at re-entry, while just the opposite result occurred during exposure of the animal to microgravity. Similar results were seen in the efferent vestibular nucleus which sends afferents to the otolith receptors !!!REF!!!, while no changes were seen in the lateral VN !!!REF!!!. In the present study we examined Fos and FRA expression in precerebellar nuclei. These areas are interesting because they send efferents to the cerebellar cortex and receive labyrinthine signals, spinal ascending somatosensory signals and descending signals originating from different areas of the cerebral cortex. We looked at the inferior olive (IO), which sends CF to different areas of the cerebellar cortex, the lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) and the basilar pontine nuclei (PN), which project MF to the cerebellar cortex !!!REF!!!. The LRt contains both parvicellular (LRtPC) and magnocellular (LRt) regions that receive predominantly spinal ascending and cortical descending pathways, respectively !!!REF!!!. A third subarea of this structure is closely related to the spinal nucleus of the fifth nerve (LRt5S). LRt neurons respond not only to spinal ascending and cortical descending volleys, but also to macular labyrinth stimulation !!!REF!!!. The PN receive descending afferents from many cortical areas, such as the motor and somatosensory regions, the posterior parietal, the superior temporal and visual cortical areas projecting to broadly located areas of the contralateral cerebellar cortex (cf. !!!REF!!!), as well as from noncortical afferents directed to cerebellar interpositus and dentate nuclei !!!REFs!!!. Major subdivisions of the cerebral hemispheres project to largely segregated multiple patches in mosaic-like parts of the PN, as shown in several animal species !!!REF!!!, including the rat !!!REFs!!!. Fos and FRA expression were used to identify whether these areas are activated by changes in gravity force or by other types of signals which might have exerted a compensatory role during the space mission. It is likely that Fos expression induced by gravity changes at launch or re-entry could not be identified in animals sacrificed 24h after launch or landing, since Fos protein disappears 4–8h after its induction. Consequently, Fos expression observed in these rats is presumably related to recent events occurring in the few hours prior to sacrifice. These include external extralabyrinthine (somatosensory, visual) signals or internal signals such as those due to changes in the animal’s state (sleep–waking cycle, stress; !!!REF!!!). Alterations in gravity force may show their effects on changes in FRA expression, which can still be detected 24h after launch or re-entry. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) system plays a prominent role in the control of somatic functions, in particular in the regulation and adaptation of VSR and VOR !!!REFs!!! and in the compensation of the vestibular deficits following unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL) !!!REF!!!. In a previous study !!!REF!!! we postulated that the induction of Fos and FRA proteins observed in the VN during the Neurolab Space Mission was the result of two kinds of inputs: a direct activation from the labyrinthine system, and an “indirect” parallel activation by the noradrenergic LC neuromodulatory system. There is evidence that LC neurons respond to stimulation of macular receptors !!!REFs!!!; by releasing norepinephrine, they may induce IEG expression in their target structures (cf. !!!REFs!!!). Precerebellar nuclei, including the IO, LRt and PN, project to different areas of the cerebellar cortex and all receive direct noradrenergic afferents from the LC !!!REFs!!!. We decided, therefore, to compare the changes in Fos and FRA expression observed in these structures with the pattern previously described in the LC !!!REF!!!. The possible involvement of the LC system in vestibular system plasticity led us to hypothesize that this system could play a prominent role in mediating cerebellar changes responsible for adaptation to microgravity and/or readaptation to the terrestrial environment during space flight. Preliminary results of this study were presented at the 52nd Meeting of the Italian Physiological Society held in Ancona, September 25–28, 2001 !!!REF!!!.  L. of the family composite is a herb found naturally in China and Europe, but has been spread to North America and other parts of the world. The plant has been used for many centuries in Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of fever and malaria !!!REF!!!. Artemisinin, a compound isolated from the leaves of L., is believed to be the substance responsible for the herb’s reputed antimalarial activity, and its efficacy has been acclaimed !!!REFs!!!. Artemisinin is now considered to be one of the most consistent drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated and cerebral malaria caused by chloroquine resistant strains of !!!REFs!!!. Its rapid action, low toxicity and powerful effect against falciparum malaria made it a favored subject for research. Studies have also shown that artemisinin is active against bacterial and some parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract !!!REF!!!. Although there is good evidence that short-term therapy with artemisinin compounds is safe, questions about cardiac and neurologic toxicity and long-term toxicity require resolution. The use of artemisinin in the treatment of cerebral malaria raises the prospect of other possible central nervous system (CNS) effects !!!REF!!!. Majority of drugs used for the treatment of this potentially fatal disease that affect the CNS must cross the blood brain barrier freely !!!REF!!!. Since its isolation in 1971, the chemistry and antimalarial effects of artemisinin have been extensively studied !!!REF!!!. For instance, artemisinin is reported to be an unusually stable sesquiterpene lactone bearing a peroxy bridge that is essential for its activity. The compound is hydrophobic and passes biological membranes easily !!!REF!!!. For instance, Genovese et al. !!!REF!!! have studied the effects of a single dose of beta-arteether derivatives of artemisinin in rats and found that it can produce a pattern of brainstem neuropathology, and that specific brainstem nuclei, including auditory nuclei, are particularly vulnerable to it. However, work on the central effects of artemisinin has been essentially neglected. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the behavioural effects of the high acute doses of artemisinin with the hope that the data might give an insight into the possible toxic activity of artemisinin and guide subsequent studies on the CNS.  Preterm delivery is the leading cause of perinatal mortality, and occurs in nearly 20% of all pregnancies in the United States !!!REF!!!, necessitating the common use of β-adrenoceptor (βAR) tocolytics to arrest labor. βAR stimulants relax uterine smooth muscle but also penetrate the placenta to stimulate βARs in the fetus, with several beneficial actions in the event of preterm delivery, including the production and release of lung surfactant and promotion of neonatal cardiovascular function !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, there are potentially adverse effects of excessive fetal βAR stimulation, including altered glucose metabolism, tachycardia, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders !!!REFs!!!, and several studies have pinpointed cellular mechanisms that may underlie developmental toxicity targeted toward developing tissues that are enriched in βARs !!!REFs!!!. Terbutaline is the most widely used tocolytic βAR agonist, involving between 200,000 and 1 million pregnancies in the US annually !!!REFs!!!, despite the fact that this particular use is “off-label”. As reviewed recently !!!REF!!!, the unique events that contribute to the developmental toxicity of drugs like terbutaline, center around three factors: (1) immature cells are resistant to agonist-induced βAR desensitization and instead, sensitize in response to prolonged stimulation; accordingly, overstimulation leads to intensification of responses instead of protective homeostatic adjustments; (2) overproduction of cyclic AMP in response to prolonged βAR stimulation can disrupt patterns of cell differentiation and elicit inappropriate apoptosis; (3) unique mechanisms exist in the developing organism such that βAR stimulation can suppress the expression of other G-protein-coupled receptors whose activities serve to counter the effects of βAR agonists. The latter component is of especial interest because of the important role played by neurotransmitters that inhibit cyclic AMP production through the participation of the inhibitory G-protein, Gi. During development, neurotransmitters serve a trophic function, coordinating the patterns of cell replication, differentiation and apoptosis in their targets !!!REFs!!!. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate some of these essential functions !!!REFs!!! and we found that, uniquely during development, βAR stimulation downregulates these receptors in the heart and reduces the expression and function of Gi, the protein that couples the receptors to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase !!!REFs!!!. This effect represented a true βAR-muscarinic receptor crosstalk in that the effect occurred only in cells expressing both receptors !!!REF!!!. In the current study, we turned our attention to another Gi-coupled receptor, the α2-adrenoceptor (α2AR). In many developing tissues, the α2AR is overexpressed relative to adult levels !!!REFs!!!, and discrete functions have been hypothesized to be related to the exuberant receptors. In the immature brain, α2ARs are associated with zones with rapid cell proliferation !!!REFs!!!. In the heart, a similar pattern is seen, with receptor overexpression in association with high mitotic rates and declining as cells become postmitotic !!!REFs!!!. However, in addition, α2ARs may participate in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton !!!REF!!! and in the physiological response to challenges, such as hypoxia !!!REF!!!. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of a preferential β2AR agonist (terbutaline), and a mixed β1/β2AR agonist (isoproterenol), on the expression of α2ARs in the fetal and neonatal rats, contrasting peripheral tissues and brain regions that overexpress the receptor during development with others that do not. Rats are altricial !!!REF!!!, so we incorporated both prenatal and postnatal exposure regimens: gestational days (GD) 17–20, postnatal days (PN) 2–5, PN11–14, PN21–24, and treatment in adulthood. In addition, because the decline in α2ARs in peripheral tissues coincides with the development of sympathetic innervation !!!REF!!!, we investigated the effects of neonatal destruction of sympathetic innervation with the selective neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), so as to determine whether there is a role for endogenous βAR input in the ontogenetic decline of α2ARs.  While angiotensin II is best known for its role in blood pressure regulation, Na+ balance and fluid homeostasis !!!REFs!!! recent evidence suggests that it may also play a role in tissue development and repair as well as immune responsiveness !!!REF!!!. It appears to exert these effects through two receptor subtypes, the AT1 and AT2 receptors, which were initially characterized on the basis of their differential affinities for the angiotensin II non-peptide analogs, losartan and PD123319, respectively !!!REFs!!!. The AT1 receptor has been shown to be primarily responsible for fluid and Na+ homeostasis, blood pressure and cardiovascular function !!!REFs!!!. However, much less is known about the physiological roles of the AT2 receptor in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Over the last decade, several lines of evidence have suggested that the AT2 receptor may antagonize the actions of the AT1 receptor !!!REF!!!. In addition, the AT2 receptor has been suggested to participate in early development, cell proliferation and tissue repair !!!REFs!!!. For example, Makino et al. !!!REF!!! reported increases in AT2 receptor mRNA levels following global brain ischemia in rats. Similar increases have been found following glutamate stimulation of rat cortical cultures !!!REF!!!. The AT2 receptor has been reported to play a role in axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush in the adult rat !!!REF!!! and to be up-regulated following acute stroke in rats !!!REF!!!. Recent evidence has shown that the AT2 receptor can elicit an increase in the delayed rectifier K+ channel (kV) current in hypothalamic cultures !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, the AT1 receptor has been shown to inhibit the same K+ current, providing another example of the antagonistic functions of these two receptor subtypes !!!REFs!!!. Angiotensin II’s role in tissue repair and ion regulation, coupled with the importance of ionic regulation during ischemic injury, led us to examine whether angiotensin II may have a protective role during ischemia. We have recently reported that angiotensin II, acting primarily through the AT2 receptor, protects mouse cortical neurons from chemical-induced hypoxia !!!REF!!!. Hypoxia can be characterized by a reduction in ATP as well as loss of ionic homeostasis resulting in plasma membrane depolarization, cellular stress, and glutamate release !!!REF!!!. Glutamate release leads to activation of the glutamate ionotropic receptors, and specifically the NMDA receptor, which allows for cellular influx of calcium !!!REFs!!!. The duration and severity of the hypoxic insult can result in apoptosis, and under the most severe conditions necrosis. During hypoxia, calcium overload of the mitochondria results in the release of cytochrome- and caspase-9, forming an active complex with APAF-1, which cleaves and activates downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, and initiates caspase-mediated apoptosis !!!REFs!!!. In this study, we determined whether neuronal apoptosis, resulting from sodium azide-induced hypoxia, is mediated through a caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. Various chemicals have been used to generate hypoxia in order to examine many of the pathological events/processes observed during ischemia !!!REFs!!!. For example, sodium azide induces hypoxia by preventing the electron transfer between cytochrome oxidase and oxygen. We have previously shown that sodium azide can induce apoptosis in cortical neurons and that angiotensin II, acting through the AT2 receptor, inhibits this chemical-induced apoptosis !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we determined whether caspase-3 is required in sodium azide-induced apoptosis. We also determined whether angiotensin II’s ability to protect neurons against sodium azide is due to modulation of caspase-3. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that angiotensin II, can protect cortical neurons from a caspase-3 dependent apoptotic mechanism.  Among the common molecular effects of essentially all drugs of abuse is activation of expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in the forebrain, especially in the striatum, cerebral cortex, portions of the extended amygdala, septum, and midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei (reviewed in !!!REF!!!). These IEGs act as transcription factors, regulating expression of target genes which may be involved in the synaptic remodeling and neural plasticity that underpins the transition from exploration to abuse of drugs (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Morphine induces expression of the IEGs c-Fos and JunB in the dorsomedial striatum, parietal and cingulate cortex, and several midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, recent retrograde tracing studies combined with c-Fos localization have demonstrated that both areas of cortex, as well as midline-intralaminar thalamic nuclei, are all part of a system of neural circuits that are activated by acute administration of morphine !!!REF!!!. Although an involvement of NMDA glutamate receptors in morphine-induced c-Fos expression has been reported !!!REFs!!!, there is little understanding of the intracellular events leading to induction of IEG expression following systemic morphine injection. Because of the involvement of protein kinases, especially protein kinase C (PKC) in induction of IEG expression (reviewed in !!!REF!!!) and in the regulation of glutamate receptor function (reviewed in !!!REF!!!) and glutamate release (e.g. !!!REF!!!), we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of PKC would block morphine-induced c-Fos expression in the striatum. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that morphine would induce translocation of specific PKC isoforms that are found in brain regions where morphine induces IEG expression. We focused on translocation of the βI and βII isoforms of PKC for two reasons. First, these two isoforms are expressed widely in the brain, but in different sets of neurons !!!REFs!!!. For example, in the cortex, PKC βI is expressed primarily in interneurons, whereas PKC βII is expressed in pyramidal neurons in layers 2/3, 5 and 6 !!!REF!!!. Second, others have shown that both acute and chronic administration of morphine modulates expression of the β isoform of PKC !!!REFs!!!; however, these studies did not discriminate between the βI and βII isoforms of PKC, and did not provide information on changes in subcellular distributions of PKC β.  Mutant mice are used increasingly to study the function of brain circuits involved in normal and pathological conditions. In this context, as the genes responsible for human diseases are identified through linkage studies, it is becoming feasible to develop approaches for the systematic determination of both gain-of-function disorders (in which a mutant protein or a wild-type gene is over expressed) and loss-of-function disorders (in which a native gene is inactivated or a protein is nonfunctional). Currently, a number of genetically altered mice are being used to model human neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s chorea and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies !!!REF!!!. As part of this approach, we have undertaken a multidisciplinary scale screening of a mutant mouse that displays well-characterized behavioral abnormalities, namely, circling behavior and hyperactivity. These mutant mice (referred to as , ) were serendipitously generated by microinjection of a 24-kb genomic fragment containing the mouse -2d renin gene into BCF (C57BL/10Rospd×C3H/HeRos) fertilized oocytes !!!REF!!!. Genetic and physical analysis of this insertion revealed that 2.5 copies of the transgene, comprising 65–70-kb, had integrated, duplicated and inverted portions of a particular locus within chromosome 16 of the mouse genome. This suspected loss-of-function disorder is expressed only when bred to homozygosity and mating studies indicate an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance !!!REF!!!. Thus, mice homozygous for the transgene insertion show the circling behavioral phenotype, whereas heterozygotes are phenotypically normal. As stated previously, the mouse may therefore be useful for modeling additional human pathologies, particularly those characterized by motor behavior abnormalities !!!REF!!!. Indeed, a number of chemical aberrations within the basal ganglia of mice point to the possibility that dopamine-based circuits may have been altered as a result of the aforementioned transgenic insertional mutation !!!REF!!!. As dopamine dysregulation has been implicated in the etiology of several motor pathologies, we tested the possibility of whether the mouse could be used for understanding some of the behavioral and brain abnormalities often seen in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions and both affective and behavioral abnormalities. Although this brain disorder has a strong genetic basis, attempts to localize susceptibility loci have produced few unequivocal and/or replicable findings !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, it is generally acknowledged that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving dysfunctional prefrontal and temporal neural circuits !!!REFs!!!. While aberrant neurodevelopmental processes may increase the probability or susceptibility to develop schizophrenia, the actual onset and course of the brain disorder appears to result from specific disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission !!!REFs!!!. Strong support for this hypothesis comes primarily from the fact that antipsychotic medications exert their therapeutic effects via D2 dopamine receptor blockade !!!REFs!!!. Morphometric research into the structural basis of schizophrenia has also revealed that schizophrenics have an increased incidence of cerebral anomalies such as enlargement of the lateral ventricles, agenesis of the corpus callosum and alterations in the density of dendritic spines in the dorsal prefrontal cortex !!!REFs!!!. Thus, it appears that schizophrenia consists of several pathogenically diverse brain deficits, of which one or more could have profound functional consequences, particularly for those psychological functions that are impaired in afflicted individuals. Finding animal models of schizophrenia therefore is a fundamental but technically demanding goal for scientists studying the neurobiology of this brain disorder (for review, see !!!REF!!!). The use of genetically altered animals such as the mouse, although subject to several experimental caveats, could potentially define or clarify some of the abnormalities underlying the behavioral and structural brain deficits associated with schizophrenia.  Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder due to deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A !!!REF!!!. Significant clinical features are acroparesthesiae, neuropathic pain, hypohidrosis and cutaneous angiokeratoma. Morbidity is secondary to renal failure and cardiac conduction abnormalities together with an increased incidence of early onset stroke !!!REF!!!. In a descriptive meta-analysis of 53 cases of Fabry disease, the predominant area of stroke was found to be the vertebro-basilar system. Ischemic stroke was related to both small and large vessel disease together with cardio-embolic etiologies !!!REFs!!!. Endothelial cell abnormalities were also considered, as was platelet activation due to a procoagulant state. Subsequent investigations have demonstrated evidence for both endothelial dysfunction !!!REFs!!!, and a procoagulant state !!!REF!!!. The etiology of large vessel disease is thought to be glycosphingolipid deposition in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in dolchiectasia, stretching and distortion of arterial tributaries together with artery-to-artery embolization and thrombosis. Small vessel disease, however, may be due to progressive occlusion secondary to glycosphingolipid deposition, but this is less clear !!!REF!!!. Although deep small infarcts were found in 10 of the 53 patients, known risk factors for small vessel disease such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus could not be excluded as confounding etiologies !!!REF!!!. Hypertension and age greater than 60 years are known risk factors for abnormal white matter lesions (WML) detected by CT or MR imaging !!!REFs!!!. The association with hypertension may be particularly important in considering the natural history of Fabry disease where development of chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension is a significant co-morbidity. The pathogenesis of WML was recently reviewed !!!REF!!!, and patients with severe involvement of the white matter are at an increased risk of stroke !!!REF!!!. Combined chronic white matter ischemia, altered cerebral autoregulation, structural changes in the unique vascular supply of the deep and periventricular white matter together with abnormal interstitial fluid circulation were all considered potentially contributory. The deep periventricular and posterior predominant WML in Fabry disease are best observed in fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI (FLAIR) sequences, with progressive radiological evidence of disease appearing approximately after the age of 25 years !!!REF!!!. To date there have been no studies correlating the radiological findings in Fabry disease with serial histopathological section analysis allowing demonstration of occlusive cerebrovascular small vessel disease. The etiology of WML in Fabry disease therefore remains unclear. Previously we found elevated resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in Fabry disease using H2O15 and PET !!!REFs!!!. However, the relationship between this flow abnormality and the development of WML is not immediately evident. Autopsy studies of Fabry patients have demonstrated widespread glycosphingolipid neuronal storage !!!REF!!!. It is possible that the increased rCBF due to neuronal hyper-metabolism, as seen in at least one other lysosomal disorder, might increase vulnerability to WML !!!REF!!!. In order to determine whether the elevated resting rCBF was secondary to increased metabolism we examined cerebral metabolism using 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) and PET !!!REF!!!. Further subgroup analysis was performed on patients with MRI FLAIR lesions (lesion group) and those without such lesions (non-lesion group).  Cognitive dysfunction is characteristic of schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive abilities on neuropsychological tasks related to attention, memory, and executive function !!!REF!!!. For example, since the 1960s experimental findings have demonstrated deficits in verbal and visual short-term memory among individuals with schizophrenia !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, impaired long-term memory !!!REF!!! and procedural memory !!!REF!!! have been noted in schizophrenia. Studies of pharmacological agents that potentially limit memory impairment in schizophrenia are particularly important in the rehabilitation of these patients. Our group decided to test the effect of Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on a variety of memory tasks in schizophrenic patients. The 5-HT3 receptor is unique in that it is the only known serotonergic receptor directly linked to an ion channel !!!REF!!! and converging lines of evidence indicate that the pharmacological blockade of 5-HT3 receptors has significant memory-enhancing effects in rodents, primates and humans !!!REFs!!!. Tests for possible interactions between the 5-HT3 system and synaptic plasticity revealed that antagonists of this receptor facilitate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) both in hippocampal slices !!!REFs!!! and CA1 of freely moving animals !!!REF!!!. Recent physiological studies have revealed that systemic injection of the selective 5-HT3 antagonist Ondansetron, facilitates induction of LTP and enhances retention of memory. Moreover, administration of low doses of Ondansetron significantly improved performance on spatial navigation on the T-Maze and Morris Water Maze Tasks in rats !!!REFs!!!, as well as on cognitive tasks in marmosets !!!REF!!!. Although Ondansetron had no effect on scopolamine-induced memory impairments when tested on normal elderly volunteers !!!REF!!! or young healthy volunteers !!!REF!!!, preliminary results in humans and animals have suggested a role for this agent in improving cognitive abilities. In this double-blind crossover study, we decided to examine the effects of Ondansetron on a variety of memory tasks in individuals with schizophrenia.  A major application of acupuncture is for pain relief !!!REF!!!. However, the mechanism underlying the pain-relieving effect is far from clear. Activation of the opioid system is a well documented phenomenon during acupuncture !!!REF!!!. Thus, the analgesic effects of acupuncture can be attenuated either by systemic treatment of the opioid antagonist naloxone !!!REFs!!!, or by intracerebral microinjection of naloxone into opioid receptor-containing brain sites !!!REF!!!. Moreover, opioid release in the cerebrospinal fluid has been found in human following acupuncture !!!REFs!!!. The colocalization of Fos-containing neurons and beta-endorphin-positive neurons in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland further suggests that the pituitary gland is activated by acupuncture to release opioids !!!REF!!!. However, despite the ample evidence supporting the concept that acupuncture activates the endogenous opioid system to produce analgesia !!!REFs!!!, the role of opioids in mediating acupuncture-induced analgesia in human subjects is controversial !!!REFs!!!. Most notably, the pain-relieving effects of acupuncture in chronic pain patients are naloxone-resistant !!!REFs!!!. Apparently, discrepancies exist between the results of experimental studies and clinical findings with regards to the role of opioids. It seems that opioids only contribute to the transient antinociceptive effect of acupuncture !!!REFs!!!, whereas acupuncture relief from the more complex clinical pain is non-opioid-dependent !!!REFs!!!. It is therefore necessary to study the mechanism of acupuncture and the contribution of opioids using different animal models. Many pain conditions that have been treated by acupuncture, such as tendonitis !!!REF!!!, oesteoarthritis !!!REFs!!!, and rheumatoid arthritis !!!REFs!!!, involve inflammation. Evidence is accumulating that acupuncture has anti-inflammatory effects !!!REF!!!, in addition to analgesia. However, the role of opioid activation in mediating the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture is uncertain, although opioids are known to have anti-inflammatory properties both within the central nervous system and in the periphery !!!REFs!!!. It has been reported that naloxone partially blocks the anti-inflammatory effect of acupuncture in a capsaicin-induced edema model !!!REF!!!, but similar findings have not yet been shown in other models of inflammation. The carrageenan (CA)-induced edema is a widely used model for screening anti-inflammatory drugs !!!REF!!!. The first objective of the current study was to use this model to examine the anti-edematous effect of low frequency electroacupuncture (EA) and the contribution of the opioid system to this phenomenon. Low frequency EA is known to produce opioid-dependent analgesia and to inhibit Fos expression evoked by noxious stimulation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord !!!REFs!!!. Fos is the protein product of the c- gene, which is considered one of the candidate immediate early genes for coupling excitation of neurons to long-term adaptive modifications of transcription. The expression of Fos protein has been used previously as a marker for increased neuronal activity in response to inflammation as well as to noxious stimulation !!!REFs!!!. However, little is known about the effect of acupuncture on c- expression evoked by acute local inflammation without association with pain. The second objective was therefore to determine the effect of acupuncture on c- expression in the spinal cord associated with inflammation.  Hippocampal theta rhythm, a sinusoidal pattern of EEG activity ranging from 3 to 13Hz; changes in accordance with the behaviour displayed by an animal !!!REFs!!!. Theta activity ranging from 6 to 9Hz occurs when animals display voluntary motor behaviours such as running, head movements, rearing, jumping, visual exploration, manipulation of objects with the forelimbs, and swimming (type I behaviours), and has been called high-frequency theta or theta type 1. During reflective behaviours such as grooming, eating, chewing and licking (type II behaviours), however, a large amplitude irregular activity (LIA) with short periods of RSA ranging from 4 to 7Hz predominates !!!REFs!!!. Because all type I voluntary motor behaviours are closely related to environmental information !!!REF!!!, the theta activity registered under these conditions could underlie the processing of environmental information by the hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. Accordingly, the appearance of a theta rhythm when new and significant information is perceived, as well as during the execution of orientated responses by animals has been reported !!!REF!!!. Moreover, this activity has been related to both the coding of new information !!!REFs!!! and the establishment of episodic memory !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, based on the close relationship between hippocampal theta activity and the movement’s occurrence, a role has been suggested for the hippocampus in the guidance and execution of movements !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of theta activity has been related to an increase in the velocity and magnitude of motor behaviour, and a relationship between theta activity and movement selection or initiation has been suggested !!!REFs!!!. It has been reported that theta activity changes in relation to the behavioural state, i.e., from an immobile and awake condition to walking !!!REF!!!. An increase in the percentage of theta activity from immobility to walking has been reported, which was interpreted as being related to the change in the type of motor activity !!!REF!!!. However, movement through a rat’s environment is obviously critical for the rat to commit relevant aspects of it to memory !!!REFs!!!. Hence, it has been proposed that motor behaviour couples with theta activity to encode information during locomotion !!!REF!!!. This issue highlights a relevant point to consider when studying theta activity; namely, that both components, locomotion and coding, could result in changes in such activity. Previously, we reported a significant difference between basal theta activity and that observed when searching for a goal in a place-learning task, although this was observed only in the high-frequency sub-band of theta activity (6.5–9.5Hz). This difference occurred at the elapse of the training days, and was produced by a non-significant increase in high-frequency activity during the searching, along with a non-significant decrease in this activity during basal recording !!!REF!!!. Although a relationship between these changes and spatial information acquisition may have existed, no differences between days of training were observed in the analysis of the broad theta activity that occurred concomitantly to the task !!!REF!!!. However, analysis of the broad range of theta activity in our previous paper included changes related to both motor activity and information acquisition. Also, previous reports of increased activity from immobile/awake to locomotion did not evaluate concomitant environmental information processing !!!REF!!!. Therefore, we analysed the change in the percentage of theta activity between immobility and during swimming, while searching for a sunken platform in a Morris maze test. Analysis of the change in the percentage of theta activity from immobility to swimming, would evaluate only that part reactive to movement in the first day of training, while changes related to the spatial processing of information must occur on the subsequent training days. Thus, we hypothesize that a further increase in high-frequency theta activity must exist that is related to spatial learning during the training, and overlaying the activity related to movement.  Recent studies have indicated that nociceptors can be classified into various types according to their physiological properties !!!REFs!!!. There appear to be two main classes among cutaneous nociceptors: Aδ-high threshold mechanonociceptors (Aδ-HTM) and C-polymodal nociceptors (C-POLY), although other types of cutaneous nociceptors may also be found !!!REF!!!. For example, Aδ-mechanoheat nociceptors (Aδ-MH) are responsive to both noxious mechanical and heat stimuli !!!REF!!! and C-high threshold mechanonociceptors (C-HTM) respond to mechanical noxious stimuli, but not to heat or irritant chemicals !!!REFs!!!. Aδ- and C-cold nociceptors, which are insensitive either to mechanical or chemical stimuli, are found in the skin !!!REFs!!!. Properties of these nociceptors in cutaneous, deep tissue or visceral organs were extensively investigated in rats !!!REFs!!!, cats !!!REF!!!, monkeys !!!REF!!! and humans !!!REF!!!. These studies have clarified that the frequency distribution of various nociceptor types is different among body sites and animal species. In the orofacial region, nociceptors in the tooth pulp, oral mucosa, and temporomandibular joint have been systematically investigated in rats !!!REFs!!!. However, there have been few reports about functional properties of periodontal nociceptors in the rat. In the pathological state of periodontitis, severe dull pain or occlusal pain is usually evoked !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, strong mechanical stimuli as in biting hard substances evoke the nociceptive jaw-opening reflex !!!REF!!!, which is similar to a withdrawal !!!REFs!!!. Thus, it is important to know the physiological properties of periodontal nociceptors, because these nociceptors may be involved in disturbances of normal masticatory function. In in vivo studies previously reported, classification of periodontal nociceptors could not be investigated precisely !!!REFs!!!, because the periodontal ligaments are situated in a hard-to-reach region, between cementum and alveolar bone. Therefore, it is usually difficult to apply quantitative noxious stimuli directly to the periodontal ligaments !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we investigated the properties of periodontal nociceptors using direct stimuli in an in vitro jaw-nerve preparation of the adult rat.  Newly born mammals cannot feed by themselves after birth. They can survive by breastfeeding until they are weaned. Since suckling is crucial for the survival of mammals, it is very important to determine the underlying neural mechanisms involved in suckling. The buccolabial muscles seem essential in milk drinking by their actions of the direct closure of the lips and the creation of the intraoral negative pressure !!!REF!!!. These muscles are developmentally derived from the second pharyngeal arch and are innervated by the facial nerve !!!REFs!!!. However, no mention was made of functional role of the facial nerve on suckling in mammals. We made bilateral resection of facial nerves at the early neonatal stage, and examined whether these animals could survive by suckling and, if they could, to what extent the nerve resection affected their postnatal growth.  Neurotrophic factors are essential for the functional stability and plasticity in the adult nervous system !!!REF!!!. The binding of neurotrophins results in cellular responses via the small G-protein p21Ras, which regulates the phosphorylation of several structural and functional proteins by evoking cascade mechanisms resulting in the regulation of enzymatic activities, ionic chanels, cellular morphology and even gene expression !!!REFs!!!. Although p21Ras is a universal eukaryotic intracellular protein, the expression in brain is 5–10 times higher compared to other tissues !!!REFs!!!. Pioneering studies emphasised the crucial role of p21Ras in the differentiation of nerve cells !!!REFs!!!. However, the importance of p21Ras persists in the adult nervous system as well. Reactive elevation of p21Ras-expression has been shown in dendritic reorganisation and compensatory neosynaptogenesis following lesion !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, p21Ras is implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease !!!REFs!!!. The morphogenetic impact of p21Ras upon the adult nervous system has been previously studied in transgenic mice. Postmitotic overexpression of p21H-Ras in layer II/III pyramidal neurons results in significant somal and dendritic growth, in a more arbourised, complex dendritic tree, and consequently in an increased cortical volume !!!REFs!!!. However, morphological changes of other cortical neuronal populations have not been hitherto investigated. In the cerebral cortex, local circuit neurons provide critical inhibitory control over the activity of pyramidal neurons, which makes them essential in cortical processing. Most of the cortical local circuit neurons appear to be immunopositive for GABA !!!REFs!!!, which is expressed in one-fifth of the total neuronal population in the adult cerebral cortex !!!REF!!!. The different types of local circuit neurons establish synapses on both proximal and distal structures of other neurons. In this way, the GABA system can both efficiently control the general responsiveness of neurons, and at the same time it can finely tune the gain of particular excitatory inputs !!!REF!!!. Consequently, little alterations in the GABA circuitry can lead to profound and specific changes in the function of the cortex, which makes the relatively small population of interneurons an ideal candidate for a substrate of cortical plasticity !!!REF!!!. On this basis, the present study focuses on the morphological modulation of interneurons in response to changes in pyramidal cell morphology in p21H-Ras transgenic mice.  Central nervous system (CNS) neurons, including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), possess a very limited intrinsic potential for repair of severed axons, and instead undergo delayed retrograde degeneration !!!REFs!!!. This is in contrast to neurons with peripheral projection, such as dorsal root ganglion cells, which are capable of spontaneous axonal regeneration and restoration of function !!!REFs!!!. Expanding on these differences between growth-promoting peripheral nerves (PN) and non-growth-promoting central nerves, Vidal-Sanz et al. showed that PN grafts connected to the cut optic nerve (ON) facilitate survival and neuritogenesis of RGCs !!!REF!!!. However, those RGCs which die irrespective of grafting or generally in response to ON trauma are removed by resident retinal microglial cells !!!REFs!!!. This is in agreement with the widely accepted role for CNS microglia in the clearance of cellular debris and potentially hazardous compounds !!!REFs!!!. Analysis of the neuro-glial interactions in lesion-induced death or regrowth of RGCs requires both phenomenological information on the underlying cellular events, and experimental approaches to interfere with the microglial activation. The first was drastically improved by the availability of phagocytosis-dependent labeling techniques using fluorescent dyes, with microglia being visualized after ingestion of fluorescent RGC debris !!!REFs!!!. In order to pharmacologically interact with the axotomy-induced microglial activation, intravitreal administration of protease inhibitors or colony-stimulating cytokines have been shown to significantly decrease their neurophagic activity and thus promote RGC survival !!!REFs!!!. Despite the fact that inhibition of microglial activation exerts beneficial effects on the survival of traumatized RGCs, the regulation of microglial activity following axotomy of CNS neurons remains unclear. The rationale of the present experiments was to examine interactions between cut RGCs and microglial cells in a reaxotomy paradigm. The resistance of RGGs regenerated in peripheral-neural environment to reaxotomy is drastically increased !!!REF!!!, which is reminiscent of injured peripheral neurons !!!REF!!!. This finding implicates that trophic stimuli of the central visual target, which are considered critical to survival of developing and adult RGCs !!!REFs!!!, may be replaced by a continuous retrograde supply of graft-derived neurotrophins !!!REF!!!. Based on this hypothesis the present work aimed at manipulating the vulnerability of RGCs to phagocytosis by exposing their axons to the PN surrounding. The impact of the PN environment on neuronal survival was investigated by reaxotomy of the RGCs either within the PN graft or within the remaining ON stump, and by monitoring the fate of the neurons, including microglial responses using neuroanatomical tracing techniques.  Central administration (i.c.v.) of the peptide hormone angiotensin II (AII) stimulates thirst, blood pressure responses and a significant appetite for hypertonic sodium chloride solutions. This natriophilic action of AII has been proposed to be mediated by the AII type 1 (AT1) receptor !!!REFs!!! since it is blocked, like AII-induced increases in water intake and blood pressure, by central injection of high (mmol) doses of the non-peptide AT1 receptor-specific antagonists losartan (Los) !!!REFs!!! or irbesartan (Irb) !!!REFs!!!. In the anterior, medial, forebrain, which is involved in hydromineral regulation !!!REFs!!! and also contains receptors for AII !!!REF!!!, iontophoretic application of AII in Wistar rats produces either an increase in spontaneous activity (excitation) or a decrease in activity (inhibition), depending on the neuron !!!REFs!!!. Iontophoretic application of Los was shown to produce brief excitation lasting only during the iontophoretic application, or long-lasting excitation up to 10min after application !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, in these animals iontophoretic application of Los rarely blocked neuronal excitation in response to a subsequent local application of AII. It was thus deduced that losartan produced excitation by inhibition of an endogenous angiotensin-induced inhibition. Furthermore, it has been reported that a very low dose (20pmol) of the AT1 antagonist losartan injected into the cerebral ventricles induces a transient sodium appetite in Wistar rats !!!REF!!!. These Los-induced effects were taken as the first functional indication for both a tonic inhibitory action of AII in the forebrain and for the possible existence of different subtypes of the AT1 receptor !!!REF!!!. The hypothesis that the central mechanism of salt appetite involves the central renin–angiotensin system implies that stimulation of this system would increase salt intake in all species. However, reports in the literature suggest that in comparison to other strains, the Fischer rat has little or no basal appetite for sodium !!!REFs!!!, and does not show a salt appetite following peripherally applied AII !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, modification of the central renin–angiotensin system produces different baroreflex information in Fischer and Sprague–Dawley rats !!!REF!!!. This would suggest that the central mechanism subserving sodium appetite, particularly the central renin–angiotensin system, is modified in some manner and thus may make the Fischer rat !!!REF!!!. Here, in Fischer and Wistar rats, we compared the behavioral responses of conscious rats to intracerebroventricularly applied AII, and the neural responses in anesthetized rats using electrophysiological extracellular recording to iontophoretic application of AII and the specific AT1 receptor antagonist losartan. Parts of this work have been previously communicated in abstract form !!!REF!!!.  While angiotensin is best known for its role in cardiovascular regulation, fluid balance, and neuroendocrine function, recent studies have shown that it also influences cell growth in several tissue types !!!REF!!!. These effects appear to be mediated through two angiotensin (AT) receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2, which were initially characterized on the basis of their affinity for losartan and PD123319, respectively. Both AT1 and AT2 receptors are differentially expressed and distributed in the brain. AT1 receptors, which are most frequently associated with cardiovascular regulation and the pathogenesis of hypertension, are widely expressed in both peripheral tissues (adipose, adrenal, heart, kidney, liver, lung, testis and vascular smooth muscle) and the central nervous system !!!REFs!!!. Functionally, AT1 receptors are considered to play an important role in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure, as well as fluid homeostasis and hormone secretion !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, the functional roles for the AT2 receptor are not fully understood. Both its distribution in developing tissues, including central nervous system, and its transient expression in adult tissues following injury, suggest that it may be associated with cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Recent studies suggest that the AT2 receptor may play a role in modulating cell death !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamus, and septum) and midbrain regions, which have been reported to be more resistant to hypoxic damage and glutamate excitotoxicity than other brain regions, constitutively express high levels of AT2 receptors !!!REF!!!. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders !!!REF!!!. While glutamate ionotropic receptors have been implicated in this neurotoxicity, the NMDA receptor appears to be critical for the excitotoxic effects of glutamate on neurons !!!REF!!!. NMDA receptors are known to induce both neuronal necrosis and apoptosis, with the latter being an important feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and metabolic deficiencies of brain related to ischemic or epileptic injury !!!REF!!!. Neurons cultured from the hypothalamus/thalamus/septum/midbrain (HTSM) region constitutively express both the AT1, AT2 and NMDA receptors, providing a model in vitro system for examining the effects of angiotensin on NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Several lines of evidence suggest that angiotensin, acting through the AT2 receptor, can modulate NMDA-induced cell death. For example, Bains et al. !!!REF!!! have shown that magnocellular neurons, from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, express high levels of the AT2 receptors and are more resistant to NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity than other hypothalamic neurons. Further supporting a functional relationship between the NMDA and angiotensinergic systems, we have shown that angiotensin decreases NMDA-induced nitric oxide and cGMP production in both PC12W and NG108 cells !!!REF!!!. These effects can be blocked by PD123319, a specific AT2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that the AT2 receptor modulates NMDA receptor signaling in neurons. Recently, we reported that hypoxia-induced apoptosis is NMDA receptor-mediated in cortical neuronal cultures and that angiotensin, acting through the AT2 receptor, can protect cultured cortical neurons from this apoptotic cell death !!!REF!!!. Further understanding of the functional interaction between AT and NMDA receptors, especially as it relates to the modulatory function of angiotensin in preventing NMDA-induced neuronal injury, should provide additional insight into potential therapeutic uses of angiotensin II analogs under conditions of pathological (apoptotic) cell death. In this study, we demonstrate that glutamate and NMDA induce cell death in HTSM-cultured neurons in a dose-dependent manner, and provide evidence to support a neuroprotective role for angiotensin under conditions of NMDA-induced excitotoxicity.  Functional techniques of neuroimaging based on a metabolic-vascular approach, such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), reveal neuronal activation in terms of an increase in measured signal during the execution of a task, when compared to a “control state”, with lower or different functional involvement. This response reflects the task-induced switch between two different levels of neuronal activity !!!REF!!!. Areas showing a significant decrease of the signal have also been observed during functional fMRI and PET experiments !!!REFs!!!. Were the relationship linking neuronal firing, local metabolism and circulation to hold true also for decreased synaptic activity, then the signal decrease could well be regarded as related to neuronal deactivation !!!REF!!!. With this in mind, the investigation of signal decreases proves quite intriguing, especially given that many decreases appear to be largely task-independent !!!REF!!!. This fact supports the idea of an organized mode of brain function that is present as a baseline or default state, and suggests a modern approach to functional studies. One example of this is that suggestive deactivations of the limbic and paralimbic structures have recently been observed during cognitive tasks !!!REF!!!, and have been ascribed to an inhibition of emotional activity in order to improve the performance during on-going higher cognitive processing. Several possible scenarios are compatible with the presence of task-related signal decreases, and the investigation of the physiological origins of such phenomena, together with the definition of the intrinsic meaning of “neuronal deactivation”, has become an issue of debate. A reduced neural activity, when intended as a drop in the neural firing, can in fact result either from decreased neural input, or from an increase in synaptic inhibition due to local GABA release. The former case is associated with decreased glucose consumption and CBF, whereas the latter one causes a rise in energy demands and CBF. Metabolic-vascular approaches can thus reveal the cortical regions where the afferent function decreases, but they are not capable of distinguishing between the zones of inhibition and those of excitation !!!REF!!!. The fact that the afferent function, and not the neuronal spiking, determines all properties of the functional hemodynamic signals has widely been demonstrated by Logothetis et al. !!!REF!!! and by Lauritzen !!!REF!!!. The conclusion drawn from these observations is that, in this context, neuronal deactivation merely refers to a decreased input to a brain region. As regards the physiological genesis of signal decreases, Harel et al. !!!REF!!! suggested caution when interpreting the negative signals as deactivations, given that a simple hemodynamic effect, consisting of the so-called vascular steal, can also generate such phenomena. They indeed observed a reduction of both the BOLD signal and cerebral blood volume in higher order visual areas of the anaesthetized cat in response to full-field drifting gratings, whereas such regions are known to increase their neural activity during the task used. Somewhat similar experiments were conducted on conscious humans at 7T by Shmuel et al. !!!REF!!!. Following a partial visual field stimulation, some areas in the medial occipital cortex, strictly adjacent to the activated regions of the primary visual cortex, exhibited a drop in both the BOLD signal and cerebral blood flow. Given the stimulation used, the authors excluded an increase of neural activity in such areas; on the contrary, they showed that a reduction of the oxygen consumption rate can be deduced by applying Hoge et al.’s model !!!REF!!!, thus inferring that the observed phenomenon originated from a decreased neural activity (albeit that a contextual intervention of a pure hemodynamic effect was not excluded). Most importantly, neuronal deactivation, as emphasized by Gusnard et al. !!!REF!!!, seems to be the most suitable mechanism whenever the signal decreases are located in spatial positions which are remote from the regions where the positive signal changes take place, as the premise of a vascular steal would only be applicable to areas strictly adjacent to the activated tissue, at least in physiological conditions. Such considerations imply ambiguity in interpreting signal decreases. As a first step of investigation, before inferring deductions about the physiology and role of deactivation, we believe that it is essential to verify if different functional techniques give congruent results. In the studies conducted by Harel et al. !!!REF!!! and by Shmuel et al. !!!REF!!!, overlapping areas exhibiting a drop in BOLD and perfusion signals were shown in the visual region in correspondence of partial visual stimulation. The determination of whether or not the convergence of perfusion and BOLD data also holds true in different cortices was the main purpose of our experiment. To address this question, we focused on a human pathological model of task-related flow reduction, namely an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). It is known that the AVM presence determines a global redistribution of brain perfusion. Function-related phenomena of flow steal can be expected in such pathologies, due to an increased flow in the AVM which subtracts blood flow to other brain areas !!!REF!!!. The presence of a large AVM thus creates ideal conditions for studying how decreases in regional blood flow are detected by functional MRI, and combined BOLD-perfusion experiments can be applied to evaluate the relative sensitivity of different functional MRI approaches to reductions in CBF. In particular, we utilized an ASL sequence to obtain BOLD maps and perfusion maps in the same experimental session.  Stroke is the third leading cause of death and first major cause of disability in the developed countries. Several mechanisms of neuronal injury of stroke have been proposed, including increased excitotoxicity, calcium overload, free radicals (FRs) and activation of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP is a DNA-binding protein that uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a substrate. It protects DNA integrity and facilitates the repair of DNA strand breaks !!!REF!!!. Studies have shown that PARP over activation causes massive NAD and ATP consumption resulting in cell death before DNA repair takes place !!!REF!!!. Further depletion of energy stores under already ischemic conditions can lead to necrosis and apoptosis of neurons !!!REF!!!. It has been reported that necrosis and apoptosis is caused by DNA fragmentation !!!REFs!!!. Differential role of PARP in the regulation of necrosis and apoptosis has been postulated !!!REF!!!. Li et al. !!!REF!!! and Yao et al. !!!REF!!! have demonstrated that apoptosis contributes to the development of ischemic infarction with DNA fragmentation. Above evidence suggest the involvement of PARP in cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury. PARP inhibitors have shown to be protective in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic reperfusion injury !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we have investigated the neuroprotective effect of 4-amino-1,8-napthalimide (4-ANI), a PARP inhibitor in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)-induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats. To understand the neuroprotective mechanisms, effect of 4-ANI was studied on local cerebral blood flow, brain NAD levels and DNA fragmentation.  Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS). They consist of α and β subunits, from which nine different α (α2–α10) and three different β types (β2–β4) are known so far. In contrast to peripheral nAChRs, which have a fixed stoichiometry (2α1, 1β1, 1γ or 1ε, 1δ), these subunits form a large family of pentameric ligand gated receptors of various subunit compositions and different tissue distribution !!!REFs!!!. To study their pharmacological properties with electrophysiological methods, pairs of various α and β subunits have been expressed in oocytes (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). As compared to other members of the superfamily of ionotropic receptors (e.g. GABAA, 5-HT3, glycine receptors) nAChRs have some distinct properties (for review see !!!REFs!!!): their on-rate is rapid and followed by a fast desensitisation period (especially at the α7-homomeric receptor); their calcium permeability is high and a paradoxical upregulation of nAChRs is the consequence of chronic exposure to nicotinic agonists (see also !!!REFs!!!). In the CNS, nAChRs are responsible for the fast excitation induced postsynaptically by ACh. On the other hand, most of the central nAChRs appear to be localized on presynaptic terminals or “preterminally” !!!REFs!!!. Consequently, stimulation of presynaptic central nAChRs has been shown to induce the release of various neurotransmitters, including that of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine (ACh) itself; (for reviews see !!!REFs!!!). Since nAChRs have been proposed as possible targets for drugs to be used in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and since they may also be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and epilepsy (see !!!REFs!!!), the knowledge of their subunit composition, especially in the , is important for the development of therapeutic strategies. However, although numerous studies characterized presynaptic nAChRs in the brain of various species including rat, mice and chicken, there is—to our knowledge—only one recent investigation on presynaptic nAChRs in the human brain !!!REF!!!. The primary focus of this paper was to examine the of nAChR-evoked release of NA rather than the subunit composition of these receptors. Since, however, presynaptic nAChRs appear to exhibit significant species differences !!!REF!!!, the first aim of the present investigation is to characterize nAChRs responsible for the nicotine-evoked release of NA in the human neocortex. Secondly, we wanted to answer the question, whether facilitatory nicotinic on cholinergic axon terminals occur in this human brain region: so far such receptors have been suggested for the neocortex of mice !!!REF!!! and rats !!!REF!!!. For comparison, both questions also were studied in parallel in rat brain tissues.  The rostral third of the nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) and the caudo-medial parabrachial nucleus (PBN) function as the first and second relays in the ascending taste pathway of rodents !!!REFs!!!. Both nuclei are complex structures, comprising several cytoarchitectonically defined subnuclei, which may be functionally distinct !!!REFs!!!. For example, a limited region in the dorsal central part of the rNST, the rostral central subnucleus, contains the majority of second order taste-responsive neurons, as the terminations of afferent fibers from oral taste buds are most concentrated there !!!REFs!!!. This region also contains the largest concentration of neurons with ascending projections to the gustatory region of the PBN !!!REFs!!!. In the rat PBN, the pontine taste area has been localized to a caudal region extending across the so-called “waist” of the superior cerebellar peduncle (scp), including the ventral lateral and the central medial subnuclei !!!REFs!!!. Some other regions or subnuclei in the rNST and the PBN receive direct or indirect gustatory input, but their roles in gustatory processing are not clear. Little is known about neurotransmission in the functionally distinct regions of the rNST or the gustatory zones of the PBN. Several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have been localized to the rNST !!!REFs!!!, and, for some of these (i.e. GABA, glutamate, substance P), physiological actions on neurons within the nucleus have been assessed !!!REFs!!!. In particular, iontophoretically applied substance P (SP) has been shown to excite rNST neurons in vitro !!!REFs!!! and to modulate responses to taste solutions in vivo !!!REF!!!. Thus, SP appears to be an important neurotransmitter/modulator in gustatory processing within the first relay nucleus. Data from localization studies provide evidence that tachykinin/neurokinin receptor interactions may be extensive in the gustatory brainstem. Several investigators !!!REFs!!! have described the distribution of SP in the PBN, localizing it to subnuclei which overlap the gustatory zones. This suggests that SP may also be an important modulator at this level in the taste system. In addition, neurokinin B (NKB), another tachykinin peptide, is present in the pontine taste area and the rNST in rats !!!REFs!!!. Neurokinin 1 (NK1) and neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptors are also present in both gustatory centers !!!REFs!!!. Thus, SP is probably not the only tachykinin acting within brainstem taste circuits. In previous studies of tachykinins and neurokinin receptors, which were not concerned with taste function per se, the rNST has generally been considered a unitary structure. In such studies, the presence of neuropeptides or receptors in the rNST is reported without consideration or examination of possible regional/subnuclear distinctions. Even for the much-studied SP distribution !!!REFs!!!, information on regional variations in the distribution within rNST is limited to two studies in the hamster !!!REFs!!!. As the rNST has multiple functional regions and anatomically distinct subnuclei, it is very important to determine neuropeptide and receptor distributions at a regional level. Moreover, there has been little investigation of the distributions of the tachykinin peptides in fibers and terminal puncta in comparison to the distributions of neurokinin receptors within gustatory centers !!!REF!!!. While each of the tachykinins, SP, neurokinin A (NKA) and NKB, is considered to have a “preferred” receptor (NK1, NK2 and NK3, respectively), all three neuropeptides can bind to each of the neurokinin receptors, if present at sufficient concentration !!!REFs!!! and exert physiological effects through non-preferred receptors !!!REFs!!!. To understand how tachykinins act in gustatory centers, it is therefore important to know which neurokinin receptors are present and how they are localized in relation to tachykinin peptides. In the present study, we have performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NK1 and NK3 receptors, and for SP, to compare their regional distributions within the rNST and caudal PBN. Our results support the interpretation that regional differences in the distributions of tachykinins and their receptors are relevant to regional/subnuclear differences in function within the gustatory centers. The distributions of NK1 and NK3 receptor immunoreactivity within the rNST differ in a manner suggesting distinct roles for these receptors in processing taste input from anterior versus posterior tongue. Furthermore, specific regional “mismatches” between receptor and “preferred” tachykinin ligand suggest that atypical tachykinin/neurokinin receptor interactions (e.g. SP with NK3 receptor) may be involved in neurotransmission in some brainstem regions that process gustatory information.  Heroin is a major drug of abuse !!!REFs!!! and is one of the drugs of choice of pregnant women in the drug addicted population !!!REF!!!. Several studies have demonstrated teratogenic !!!REFs!!! and neuroteratogenic effects of heroin in humans !!!REFs!!!. Studies on animals exposed prenatally to opioids have shown alterations in multiple brain regions and innervations, resulting in numerous behavioral deficits !!!REFs!!!. In our model of heroin neurobehavioral teratogenicity, mice prenatally exposed to heroin exhibited deficits in hippocampus related behaviors !!!REFs!!! associated with a specific and unusual alteration in septohippocampal cholinergic function. Presynaptic terminals were hyperactive, as indicated by increased acetylcholine (ACh) release !!!REF!!! and by an increase in the number of choline transporter sites, assessed by [!!!MATH!!!]hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) !!!REFs!!!. Unexpectedly, the presynaptic hyperactivity, which ordinarily would evoke postsynaptic desensitization !!!REFs!!! was instead accompanied by postsynaptic !!!REFs!!!, suggesting a deficiency in the ability of presynaptic neurons to evoke postsynaptic cell signals. This was confirmed by the specific loss of protein kinase C (PKC) responses to cholinergic receptor stimulation in the heroin-exposed offspring !!!REFs!!!. There is a causal relationship between cholinergic synaptic alterations evoked by prenatal heroin exposure and the resultant behavioral deficits, as both are restored to normal by subsequent grafting of septal cholinergic cells into the hippocampus in adulthood !!!REF!!!. The fact that the neurochemical and functional alterations are reversed when new cholinergic connections are made suggests that at least some of the heroin-induced impairment of synaptic communication reflects architectural “errors” in the distribution of cholinergic terminals within the hippocampus. Indeed, such an effect would account for simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic hyperactivity in the face of impaired net synaptic function. In the present study, we evaluated quantitative localization of the presynaptic choline transporter using [!!!MATH!!!]HC-3 autoradiography !!!REF!!! on postnatal (PN) days 15 and 25, periods that represent critical milestones of hippocampal synaptic development !!!REFs!!!, as well as in adulthood (PN53), when behavioral manifestations are fully evident !!!REF!!!. In adulthood, sex-dependence of the effects were evaluated, since previous studies indicate sex-selectivity of the effects of prenatal exposure to morphine on other neurotransmitter systems !!!REF!!!.  The early studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) established that AD patients suffer from damage to the central and peripheral levels of writing. The central deficits arise from a linguistic problem affecting the phonological or semantic spelling system, and the peripheral deficits from damage to the allographic level (i.e. the level responsible for case and style assignment) or grapho-motor level. AD patients exhibit impairments at the lexico-semantic level. Their written narratives are characterised by empty phrases and indefinite terms, poor narrative organisation, semantic and graphemic substitution errors, word omissions and intrusions, and a reduction in the number of pictorial themes described !!!REF!!!. Most language research in AD has focused upon oral production, but numerous studies have found written measures to be more sensitive indicators of the language dysfunction in AD than dysnomia !!!REFs!!!. Although there is relative preservation of motoric output, phonology and syntax in speech, AD patients frequently produce spatially disordered writing, generate graphemic paraphasias and construct written sentences that are shorter and less grammatically complex than those produced by controls !!!REF!!!. AD patients also show a pattern of surface dysgraphia in that the writing of irregular words (e.g. YACHT) is significantly impaired relative to regular words, and the majority of phonological errors produced are plausible (e.g. YOT), indicating over-reliance on the phonological system !!!REFs!!!. As the disease advances, the impairment does spread to the phonological system !!!REF!!! and phonologically implausible errors become dominant (i.e. YARK). To assess whether spelling abilities do degenerate in a uniform pattern with disease progression, the error pattern shown by mild and moderate AD patients during the spelling of regular, irregular and non-words has been compared !!!REF!!!. In contrast to the previous studies, the authors could not differentiate the patient groups in terms of error type, and found that both groups suffered from a primary semantic impairment, which was coupled with a milder impairment in phonological processing. Recent findings further question the hypothesis of uniform progression from a semantic to phonological impairment, and suggest that the two systems may decline independently !!!REF!!!. The majority of AD studies have focused upon the central aspects of writing, but there is some evidence of peripheral dysgraphia among patients with AD, especially those in the moderate stages of the disease. For example, the spelling abilities of mild-to-moderate AD patients (MMSE >10 and <26) were assessed over a 1-year period !!!REF!!!. In the initial testing session, only 16% of the errors produced by the AD patients were classified as grapho-motor errors, but by the second session this figure had increased to 33%. In patients exhibiting grapho-motor impairment, there was a tendency towards simplified word output, where the patients would rely more heavily upon upper print and separate the letters rather than write cursively. In another study, minimal (MMSE 24–28) and mild (MMSE 16–23) AD patients were also more successful when copying and writing in the upper as opposed to the lower case !!!REF!!!. Since the majority of individuals are well rehearsed at writing in lower cursive, such a finding seems surprising. Children, however, initially learn to write in upper case print, suggesting that early acquired information is less vulnerable to the disease process !!!REF!!!. A case study of D.T., a 78-year-old male with AD, detailed a written output riddled with letter omissions, poorly formed strokes, stroke omissions, and stroke and letter perseverations !!!REF!!!. Severe peripheral dysgraphia with selective loss of the ability to spontaneously produce letters in either print or cursive was reported in two other case studies of patients (A.F. and E.Z.) with mild/moderate AD !!!REF!!!. In contrast, Croisile et al. found no evidence of peripheral dysgraphia in a sample of 22 mild-moderate AD patients (mean MMSE 18.9) whilst performing a written narrative description task !!!REF!!!. It should be noted, however, that they did exclude five patients because they exhibited extremely non-fluent or spatially disordered written descriptions. While previous findings are controversial, it does seem likely that in most cases the writing impairment seen in AD progresses from a central dysgraphia, which is then gradually accompanied by a secondary deficit in the more peripheral aspects of writing. The aim of this study was to determine the nature and severity of the spontaneous writing impairment experienced by minimal, mild and moderate AD patients, and to identify the components of writing that consistently differentiate AD patients from healthy controls.  The native opioid peptide, [Met5]-enkephalin, discovered in the laboratory of Kosterlitz and coworkers !!!REF!!!, serves as a tonically active negative growth factor in cell proliferation, development, neoplasia, wound healing, cellular renewal, and angiogenesis !!!REFs!!!. [Met5]-enkephalin is termed opioid growth factor (OGF) to signify its growth regulatory role in neural and non-neural cells and tissues !!!REF!!!. In the embryonic and preweaning brain, OGF has been found to be associated with germinative but not differentiated neural cells !!!REFs!!!, and receptor binding assays with radiolabeled OGF document the receptor in developing but not adult brain and cerebellum !!!REF!!!. OGF depressed DNA synthesis of neurons and glia in the 6-day-old developing cerebellum, and did so within 2h of drug administration !!!REF!!!. Moreover, OGF altered DNA synthesis for at least 24h after initiation of peptide exposure !!!REF!!!. Although some other peptides related to OGF and derived from preproenkephalin also depressed growth, a wide variety of synthetic and natural opioids—some of which were selective for classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, κ), had no effect on DNA synthesis even when applied at over 100 times the concentration required for OGF activity (80μg/kg) !!!REF!!!. OGF was found to depress DNA synthesis in the cerebrum, spinal cord, and cerebellum in the embryo !!!REF!!!. Addition of exogenous OGF has a profound inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis (e.g., reduction of 25% for neurons and 40% for glia compared to control levels) !!!REF!!!. This opioid peptide has been found to be an autocrine produced growth factor in the developing neural cells of prenatal and postnatal organisms !!!REFs!!!. OGF appears to act constitutively, as blockade of opioid receptors in the developing brain with the long-acting and potent opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX) markedly elevates DNA synthesis !!!REF!!!. OGF is in a dynamic equilibrium that provides homeostatic control of cell replication. Continuous blockade of opioid–receptor interfacing with an opioid antagonist such as NTX stimulated cell replication (e.g., 40% more DNA synthesis than in controls) (!!!REF!!!; also !!!REFs!!!). One can estimate the “full capacity” of OGF regulatory activity in cell replication by summing the effects of addition of OGF and blockade of opioid–peptide interactions, with modulation of DNA synthesis ranging up to 80%. The effect of OGF on cell replication was reversed by naloxone, suggesting a receptor-mediated action of the peptide !!!REF!!!. Receptor binding assays with radiolabeled OGF and preparations of 6-day-old rat cerebellum have demonstrated the presence of a single, saturable binding site that was of high affinity (2.2nM) with a binding capacity of approximately 22fmol/mg protein. The ontogeny of the OGF receptor (OGFr) was evaluated in the whole brain and cerebellum of rat !!!REF!!!. In both tissues, receptor binding was highest around the beginning of postnatal week 2, decreasing thereafter with no binding recorded by postnatal week 4. Using a gel overlay technique and one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, Zagon et al. !!!REF!!! showed that radiolabeled OGF bound to four polypeptides, and did so in a manner that was sensitive to naloxone and stereospecific. Using antibodies produced to these binding polypeptides, a λgt11 fetal rat brain cDNA library was screened and OGFr cDNA was cloned and sequenced in rat and, subsequently in human and mouse !!!REFs!!!. The chromosomal location of human OGFr is 20q13.3 !!!REF!!!. The molecular and protein structures of OGFr have no resemblance to that of classical opioid receptors, and have no significant homologies to known domains or functional motifs with the exception of a bipartite nuclear localization signal. The present study investigates the ontogeny of OGFr gene expression in the brain and cerebellum of rats. The gene expression of OGFr is placed into perspective with previous information on OGF receptor binding analysis !!!REF!!! in order to form a more complete picture of transcriptional and translational activity. Finally, the results from analysis of OGFr gene expression herein are related to data on the gene expression of preproenkephalin (PPE) !!!REFs!!! which encodes for OGF !!!REFs!!!, thereby providing a comprehensive picture of the ontogeny of the OGF–OGFr axis.  Release of neurotransmitters into the synapse requires the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Three soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins are critical to synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. These are the plasma membrane-associated target proteins (-SNARES) syntaxin and synaptosome-associated protein of 25kDa (SNAP-25), and the vesicular protein (or -SNARE) synaptobrevin (also known as vesicle-associated membrane protein, VAMP) (for references, see !!!REF!!!). In addition to the SNAREs, a number of SNARE-associated proteins modulate neurotransmitter release !!!REF!!!, including the complexins (CPLXs) !!!REFs!!!. The CPLXs are small hydrophilic proteins that are found throughout the mammalian brain. They are localised to presynaptic terminals where they are thought to modulate a late event in neurotransmitter release !!!REFs!!!. Two isoforms exist in the brain, CPLXI and CPLXII. These are not only highly homologous (95% identity) !!!REF!!!, but also highly conserved across species, with 100% identity between mouse, rat and human forms of CPLXII !!!REF!!!. Notably, neither isoform is essential for survival, since single knockout mice survive to maturity !!!REF!!!. However, together they play an essential role, since deletion of both genes is perinatally lethal !!!REF!!!. CPLXI and CPLXII are differentially distributed in mouse and rat brain !!!REFs!!!. In a detailed electronmicroscopic study, Ishizuka et al. found that in rat hippocampus and cortex, CPLXI is predominantly localised in axosomatic synapses and CPLXII in axodendritic synapses !!!REF!!!. Since in the hippocampus and cortex, axosomatic and axodendritic synapses are inhibitory and excitatory, respectively, this has led to the idea that the CPLXs are functionally identical, with CPLXI modulating inhibitory transmission and CPLXII excitatory transmission !!!REFs!!!. However, not all data are consistent with this idea. For example, in CPLXI and CPLXII knockout mice, there is no compensatory increase in expression of one isoform when the other is deleted !!!REF!!!. This would be expected if the CPLXs were functionally redundant and one isoform could substitute for the other. Further, the pattern of distribution of protein in the mouse brain is not consistent with CPLXII being localised exclusively to excitatory neurons. Indeed in rat, it is clear that there is positive immunostaining for CPLXII in regions that are known targets of inhibitory output from the striatum such as the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata !!!REF!!!. However, a systematic study of expression of the two isoforms has not been done in mouse. Here we have performed a detailed comparative analysis of the expression of CPLXI and CPLXII in mouse brain using in situ hybridisation. Our findings suggest that CPLXI and CPLXII are not merely functional homologues that play the same role in either inhibitory or excitatory neurons, but that their role depends upon the circuitry of the neurons in which they are expressed.  Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised by neurodegeneration in the striatum and the cortex. The causal mutation in HD is an expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of the gene that codes for the protein Huntingtin !!!REF!!!. HD is best known as a movement disorder, and motor symptoms include a number of different abnormalities including the classically described chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia. Notably, the motor abnormalities in HD are accompanied, and sometimes preceded, by cognitive deficits, mood disorders and personality changes (for references, see !!!REF!!!). However, it is not known how the genetic mutation causes either the neurological or the psychological decline in HD. Altered levels of SNAREs or SNARE-associated proteins have been found in a number of neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease !!!REFs!!!, schizophrenia !!!REFs!!!, temporal lobe epilepsy !!!REF!!!, bipolar disorder !!!REFs!!!, unipolar depression !!!REF!!! and HD !!!REF!!!. Previous studies from our laboratory also showed that in a mouse model carrying the HD mutation (R6/2 line) there was a selective and progressive decrease in the levels of a SNARE-associated protein complexin II (CPLXII) !!!REF!!!. The R6/2 mouse is an interesting model for HD. The mice show symptoms from around 8 weeks of age !!!REF!!! but motor and cognitive deficits are measured before this time !!!REFs!!!. Since no neurodegeneration is seen before 14–16 weeks of age !!!REF!!!, we suggested previously that synaptic dysfunction might be an important component of early neurological decline in R6/2 mice !!!REF!!!. Indeed in the R6/2 mouse model, the progressive depletion of CPLXII from the brain parallels the onset of the abnormal histological and neurological phenotypes !!!REFs!!!. In our previous study, we used synaptosome homogenates of different regions of brain for our analysis. However, this approach takes no account of regional distribution of expression of these proteins. Further, measurements of total protein cannot distinguish between changes in protein turnover and a decrease in expression. In this study therefore, we used in situ hybridisation to examine expression levels and distribution of SNAREs (25kDa synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25), syntaxin-1A and synaptobrevin-2) and SNARE-associated proteins (α-SNAP, CPLXI and CPLXII) in R6/2 mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. We used mice between 3 weeks of age, when R6/2 mice appear normal, and 15 weeks of age, by which time they are profoundly affected by the disease. We found no changes in the mRNA expression of SNARE proteins up to 15 weeks of age. However, mRNA expression of SNARE-associated proteins, particularly CPLXII but also CPLXI and α-SNAP, were selectively and progressively downregulated in the R6/2 mouse. Our data support the suggestion that early changes in expression of SNARE-associated proteins play a role in the progressive neurological phenotype of the R6/2 mouse.  AP-1 transcription factors are among the best-characterized inducible DNA-binding proteins in the brain. The family is composed of seven cloned members. These include the Fos-related proteins c-Fos, FosB, Fos-related antigen 1 (FRA-1) and FRA-2 and the Jun-related proteins c-Jun, JunB and JunD. Homo- and hetero-dimerization amongst family members !!!REF!!!, regulated by both expression and post-translational modification !!!REF!!!, affords AP-1 DNA binding complexes varied affinity for specific DNA elements and results in differential effects on gene transcription. Cross talk between AP-1 signaling and other pathways adds a further level of complexity to transactivation !!!REFs!!!. The result of these interactions is a complex signaling response capable of producing many and varied downstream effects. In brain, AP-1 activity is involved in plasticity, neuronal adaptation to injury !!!REFs!!! and tolerance induction in ischemic models !!!REF!!!. In addition, it functions in initiating cell death programs !!!REFs!!!. Analysis of individual Fos and Jun proteins further supports this dual involvement in neuronal survival and death processes. Close scrutiny of protein expression patterns following kainic acid treatment reveal that upregulation of individual AP-1 proteins differs temporally and regionally, thus occurring in cell populations that will both succumb to and survive the injury !!!REF!!!. c-Jun has been linked to neuronal apoptosis !!!REFs!!! as well as neuronal rescue !!!REFs!!!. Preconditioning ischemia studies have demonstrated an association between neuronal death and JunB expression in the gerbil !!!REF!!!. Similarly, FosB is induced in hippocampal CA1 neurons destined to succumb to ischemic injury !!!REFs!!!. Knockout of c-Fos expression results in enhanced excitotoxic death of neurons !!!REF!!! but c-Fos expression is also seen in neurons destined to die !!!REF!!!. c-Fos expression has been linked to the spreading depression characteristically seen in stroke models !!!REF!!! and antisense studies suggest a protective role for the protein in the response to stroke !!!REF!!!. In line with the production of a multifarious response by AP-1, individual members demonstrate different kinetics of induction according to the stimulus. For example, several FRA-immunoreactive proteins are induced by seizures, yet the time-course of expression differs in a brain region-specific manner !!!REFs!!!. In the context of brain injury, many of the AP-1 proteins are induced quickly and transiently but examples of extended AP-1 activation have also been described. In particular, JunD, FRA-2 and the 35kDa FRA protein can be elevated for months after some forms of brain injury !!!REFs!!!. Together, these observations have led to the hypothesis that differing AP-1 components modulate genes in defined temporal sequences; acutely-induced AP-1 proteins regulate a distinct set of genes on a short-term basis while the persistently upregulated AP-1 factors alter expression of an alternate set of genes. Although the effect of AP-1 on transcription is highly dependent on the composition of the complex !!!REF!!!, analysis to date has focused on a relative few members of the family. One AP-1 protein that has not been widely studied is FRA-2. This protein is an important signaling component in development and differentiation !!!REFs!!!. It was originally identified by its induction in growth-stimulated chicken embryo fibroblasts !!!REF!!! but is also upregulated in response to injury to the brain and the kinetics of this induction are prolonged !!!REF!!!. Long-term expression of proteins such as FRA-2 suggests a role in the processes of neuronal adaptation, survival and repair. To address the incongruities in the literature regarding the role of AP-1 members in the injury response and to better understand the role of the FRA-2 protein and its relative c-Fos, this study has employed the MCAO model of ischemia. The advantage of this model lies in the regional differences in injury response. The insult produces acute death in the ipsilateral hemisphere, referred to as the core infarct and including the striatum and frontoparietal cortex, as well as two regions that exhibit delayed death. One of these, the penumbra, surrounds the striatal/cortical core of the affected hemisphere. The hippocampus displays inconsistent involvement but when affected exhibits neuronal death in a delayed fashion and demonstrates further differences in susceptibility amongst subregions. Comparison of protein expression between these affected regions, therefore, allows a degree of interpretation of the role of the induced protein.  Epilepsies are a group of disorders characterized by recurrent seizures, resulting from non-controlled firing of neurons of either the whole cortex (generalized epilepsies) or localized brain areas (partial epilepsies). Both generalized and partial epilepsies may be classified as symptomatic (identifiable structural or metabolic brain abnormalities), cryptogenetic (hypothetical structural or metabolic brain abnormalities) or idiopathic (no identifiable causes). While symptomatic and cryptogenetic epilepsies are mostly due to acquired brain lesions and do not have a significant genetic component, idiopathic epilepsies are mainly due to genetic causes. Idiopathic epilepsies include disorders displaying simple (Mendelian, i.e. monogenic) or complex (oligo- or polygenic) inheritance patterns. While our knowledge about the molecular basis of complex idiopathic epilepsies is very limited, specific gene defects have been identified in four forms of the disease, namely, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Among them, ADNFLE is the first idiopathic epilepsy where a specific gene defect has been identified. This syndrome, first described in 1994 and often misdiagnosed as nightmares or parasomnias, is characterized by clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures with a frontal lobe semiology, occurring during non-REM sleep (for review, see !!!REF!!!). The use of video-polysomnography, combined with a careful analysis of clinical features, allows a differential diagnosis of this form of epilepsy from conventional parasomnias. ADNFLE is clinically distinctive and relatively homogeneous, even though intra- and interfamilial variability in seizure severity, age of onset (usually in childhood) and specific frontal lobe seizure manifestations can be observed !!!REFs!!!. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance (70–80%) !!!REF!!!. So far, three loci, ENFL1 (MIM#600513), ENFL2 (MIM∗603204) and ENFL3 (MIM#605375), have been associated with ADNFLE, but only for two of them (ENFL1 and ENFL3) mutations in specific genes have been identified. As far as ENFL1 locus is concerned, four different mutations (Ser248Leu, Ser252Phe, 776Ins3 and Thr265Ile, the last characterized by a very low penetrance of 29%) in the gene, coding for the α4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), located on chromosome 20q13.2, have been found in 10 families !!!REFs!!!. The ENFL2 locus has been mapped on chromosome 15q24 by means of linkage analysis in a single family !!!REF!!!, but the underlying gene was not identified. The ENFL3 locus has been identified on chromosome 1q21 !!!REF!!!. Two different mutations (Val287Met and Val287Leu), affecting the same aminoacid residue, in the gene, coding for the β2 subunit of the nAChR, were found in three families !!!REFs!!!. All identified mutations in and are located in the second transmembrane domain (M2) of the corresponding nAChR subunit (encoded by part of exon 5 of each gene), which lines the cationic channel pore of the receptor. Ex vivo expression of the observed mutations showed that they result in alterations of the functional properties of the receptor !!!REFs!!!. Thus the concept has arisen that ADNFLE may be, at least in part, a channellopathy. However, epilepsy-causing mutations have been identified only in a minority of ADNFLE families; in the remaining ADNFLE families (more than 90%), the responsible gene/s are still unknown !!!REFs!!!. In the present paper, comprehensive results obtained by linkage and mutation analysis of ENFL1, ENFL2 and ENFL3 loci in 12 unrelated Italian ADNFLE families are presented.  Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, discovered 50 years ago by Aserinsky and Kleitman !!!REF!!!, has been considered for decades the physiological correlate of dreaming. After the era of the psychoanalytic interpretation, mental activity during sleep underwent the observation of natural science, thus giving impetus to a new field of research, the study of dreaming in the psychophysiological perspective. Since the discovery of REM, so-called “REM tunnel vision” dominated the research in the field, producing the concept of REM-dream isomorphism, i.e. that REM is the unique correlate of dreaming. Three major pieces of data supported the isomorphism model: (a) dreams are elicited only by awakening during paradoxical sleep, (b) reports’ narrative length depends on prior REM duration, and (c) REM eye movement density (EMD) is correlated with dreams’ visual imagery, this statement being better known as the “scanning hypothesis” !!!REFs!!!. Later, a rapidly growing body of literature scrutinized the relationship between REM sleep and dreaming, gradually casting doubts on the widely accepted REM-dream isomorphism. Experimental findings began to show that mental activity could be elicited from NREM sleep awakenings as well as REM awakenings. Although the incidence of NREM dream recalls varied among studies !!!REFs!!!, mental activity was recorded following awakenings at sleep onset !!!REFs!!! and following awakenings from Stage 2 and Delta sleep !!!REFs!!!. A substantial percentage of NREM awakenings have been shown to be followed by dream recall and this percentage is only slightly lower than that of REM sleep awakenings !!!REF!!!. About the same time the “scanning hypothesis” was disconfirmed by the studies on congenitally blind subjects. Although these subjects never experienced visual perception and, therefore, visual imagery either during waking or during sleep, they showed substantially normal eye movement density during REM periods of nocturnal sleep !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the qualitative differences between REM and NREM mentation !!!REFs!!! disappeared when the approach of memory association was applied to the investigation of mental activity during sleep. Cipolli et al. !!!REF!!! documented a thematic continuity of mental activity during the night rather than during the REM or NREM periods, while Cavallero et al. !!!REF!!!, a few years later, showed that dream sources, as well as dream contents, are similar in the two different states of sleep. With the narrative length controlled, there are no qualitative differences between REM and NREM reports !!!REFs!!!. In conclusion, current literature suggests that the only consistent difference between NREM and REM reports is merely quantitative: narratives from REM awakenings are generally longer than narratives from NREM sleep, although NREM reports as long as or even longer than REM reports have been described !!!REFs!!!. A different approach relates dream recall to arousal level. In 1969 Feinberg and Evarts !!!REF!!! stated that “differences in mental content on awakenings from the different stages of sleep reflect differences in the arousal of recall rather than in the ongoing mental activity at the time of awakening”. In 1976 Koulak and Goodenough !!!REF!!! proposed the so called arousal-retrieval model, suggesting that mental activity persists throughout sleep and its recall is related to the arousal level of sleep which precedes the awakening and influences memory functions. According to this point of view, different levels of arousal at the awakening account for differences in dream report length due to differences in the function of memory processes, i.e. of both memory storage and retrieval of the ongoing sleep mental activity !!!REFs!!!. The relationship between REM duration prior to the awakening and the subsequent dream report length is probably related to the experimental protocols. These experiments did not control for time of night and consequently explored mental activity from different levels of arousal. Thus, the long REM periods that precede long dream reports are likely to occur at the end of the sleep period when arousal level is high. Rosenlicht et al. !!!REF!!! tested this idea by comparing dream reports after 5 and 10min REM sleep early in the night and late in the night. Dream report length depended on time of night and not preceding REM duration. Computer analysis of the EEG activity provides a reliable measure of the arousal level during sleep. Arousal level is negatively correlated with Delta activity and positively correlated with Sigma and Beta activities !!!REF!!!. When applied to the study of the dream recall, the EEG correlates of arousal level provide contradictory evidence. Some data show that after REM sleep awakenings with dream recall were associated with higher activation level in terms of lower EEG spectral power in all frequency bands, than awakenings without dream recall !!!REF!!!. However, other studies found no relationship between REM recall and spectral power measures of sleep EEG preceding the awakening !!!REFs!!!. Two studies of dream reports following NREM sleep support the arousal hypothesis. The incidence of mental activity reported after NREM awakenings is negatively associated with Delta spectral power during the 5min preceding the Stage 2 awakenings !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the incidence of recall is positively associated with Stage 2 Beta activity prior to the awakening, even when measured during the last 32s !!!REF!!!. Nap studies provide an opportunity to test the arousal hypothesis in a short period of sleep. To the best of our knowledge, the only study on dream reports from day time sleep were from naps following lost nocturnal sleep !!!REF!!!. Besides the relevant changes in sleep architectures, with frequent sleep onset REM periods followed by Delta sleep, the authors found a higher incidence of recall associated with higher values in the EEG high frequency bands. The present study is the first attempt to investigate mental activity during early afternoon nap in healthy young subjects after a good night sleep. In addition to the incidence of recall after NREM and REM awakening, we tried to further test the scanning hypothesis by correlating the length of recalls to eye movement density during REM sleep preceding the awakening. Finally, to collect data on the possible relationship between mental activities and the arousal level of sleep immediately preceding awakening, we correlated REM and NREM recall length to the amount of Delta and Beta EEG activities measured by PSA and by PAA during sleep preceding the awakening.  Nocturnal sleep disruption is a known feature of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). These patients have very fragmented and superficial sleep compared to those affected by both idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and other partial epilepsies !!!REFs!!!. The overall poor sleep may contribute to memory and general cognitive impairment, which tends to be the rule even in patients without frequent seizures. Among the many night-time episodes, secondarily generalized nocturnal seizures are frequently reported !!!REF!!!. We have previously reported, how most of these nocturnal episodes, whether partial or secondarily generalized, actually arise out of brief arousals from light stages of sleep !!!REF!!!, rather than out of sleep itself. We would now like to make the point that some of these nocturnal seizures could be misinterpreted as benign disorders of arousal !!!REF!!!, a common form of parasomnia, frequently encountered in adolescents, and sleep deprived subjects. Though non-epileptic disorders of arousal have been reported in epileptic children, conversely, the possible ictal nature of recurrent parasomnias in TLE has not been extensively investigated. The benign looking semi-purposeful automatic activity displayed by some of these patients could escape a more accurate diagnostic ictal interpretation in the absence of online continuous video-polygraphic monitoring. Recognizing such episodes could be crucial to diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic issues including, medication response, diurnal cognitive and vigilance impairment, and compliance with drug therapy. Furthermore, it could cast new light on ultradian sleep/wake-related mechanisms of seizure precipitation. Oniroid illusions and hallucinations with strong emotional and autonomic activation have been reported to follow amygdaloid stimulation in TLE !!!REF!!!. Epstein !!!REF!!!, suggested a possible ictal interpretation of recurrent stereotyped dreams characterized by intense fear/anxiety and feeling of dread as in the diurnal auras of TLE. Others noticed increased vividness and emotionality, as typical dream features of TLE !!!REF!!!. Therefore, even recurrent nightmares in TLE could be eventually missed as subclinical nocturnal seizures. Also, they could give us more insight about nocturnal amygdaloid output in TLE.   Insomnia can be defined as the complaint of a sleep perceived as either qualitatively no satisfactory or quantitatively insufficient to restore individual psycho-physical functioning. Insomnia consequences go over the nighttime period, heavily influencing also the quality of daytime life. Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder, its prevalence in the general population increases with age but, despite the large number of insomniacs, only one third of them seek medical help specifically for this problem !!!REFs!!!. It can be classified according to at least three factors: its cause, type, and duration. Causes are commonly summarized in the five “p”s according to the initial letter of the words: physiological, physical, psychological, psychiatric, pharmacological !!!REFs!!!. As for type, insomnia can be a disorder of initiating sleep, with a sleep latency longer than 20min, a disorder of maintaining sleep, with at least two nocturnal awakenings and/or a disorder of short duration sleep with early morning awakening, but it is always a disorder of no restorative sleep !!!REF!!!. According to its duration, insomnia is classified as transient (when the sleep disorder lasts less than 1 week), short-term (when its duration ranges from 1 to 3 weeks) and long-term (when it exceeds a 3-week duration) !!!REF!!!. Patients’ medical history and literature data agree in demonstrating that often insomnia is triggered by a stress factor !!!REFs!!!. It is well established the influence of stress factors upon the hypothalamus–pituitary gland-surrenal gland axis and the cathecolaminergic neurotransmittal release with the consequential potentiation of arousal and alertness !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, stress factors can influence the course of both somatic and physical diseases and seem to predispose people to develop more easily psychopathological symptoms and to make them more vulnerable to anxious and depressive events !!!REF!!!. Moreover, stress factors might in turn act upon a predisposing personality. The Rorschach test is frequently used as a tool to assess the basic components of normal personality and its possible psychopathological features !!!REF!!!. This projective test is able to stimulate the subject to spontaneously structure an unstructured material giving it a certain shape and meaning and so showing subject personality structure and features. Puca et al. demonstrated that chronic insomniacs, examined by means of the Rorschach test, are characterized by a marked, constant and almost perseverative trend to hypocondriasis !!!REF!!!. These hypochondriac traits might explain the apparently opposite behaviours of insomniacs in the therapeutic field; in fact, in some cases they refuse drugs and in other cases overuse them, but in all cases hyperinvest on their body. Stress factors could play an important causative role not only in initiating but also in making insomnia persistent. If this was true a high prevalence of stress should be found not only in transient and short-term, but also in chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia associates with a high risk for psychiatric disorders !!!REF!!!. When approaching the psychic area, it is necessary to differentiate a psychopathological symptom, which may belong to the spectrum of symptoms of a particular “mental disorder”, from the disorder itself, which needs to fit a specific set of diagnostic criteria according to DSM-IV. In a study aiming to compare psychopathological symptoms rates in several types of sleep disorders, 75% of insomniacs showed at least one score higher than 70 in the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory !!!REF!!!. In spite insomnia appears to be less severe than sleep apnea: a study comparing two samples of patients, respectively suffering from one of these sleep disorders, reported worse levels of quality of life and illness behaviour in the former than in the latter !!!REF!!!. Most of the studies in the field of chronic insomnia focused on a specific aspect, providing in this way an incomplete outlook of the problem. The primary aim of this study was to examine a sample of chronic insomniacs, referring to a tertiary sleep centre, from multiple points of view by estimating the prevalence of stressful factors, of psychopathological symptoms and of psychiatric disorders. The secondary aim was to assess the possible changes in quality of life and illness behaviour related to chronic insomnia.  Sleep changes across age, from the early epochs of development until old age !!!REFs!!!. It has been shown that body movements, an important behavioural aspect of sleep !!!REF!!!, impressively change with age. Modifications already appear very early in development, in particular in the last weeks before term-age !!!REF!!! and in the first postnatal months !!!REF!!!. In particular, both the number and the duration of movements decrease in the early postnatal months !!!REF!!!. In the young adult, beside simple twitches of the distal muscles, there are smaller and larger body movements !!!REF!!!, the latter taking the characteristics of major postural shifts. According to Aaronson et al. !!!REF!!!, there would be about ten of these shifts per night. In the elderly, despite the several physiological changes described during sleep !!!REFs!!!, the knowledge on the pattern of body movements is still largely incomplete. The first aim of this study has been to evaluate body movements occurring during night sleep in a group of healthy elderly subjects. The frequency and duration of body movements will be compared with the one of younger subjects. The association of body movements to sleep states and their possible connection to states’ transitions is especially remarkable. Muzet et al. !!!REF!!! suggested that body movements in Stage 2 NREM may delay the transition to slow wave sleep (SWS), whereas their “increase before REM sleep may serve to produce the aroused CNS state necessary for REM sleep”. Also, the alteration of the body movements’ pattern might reflect the deterioration in sleep process !!!REF!!!. Despite its importance, this topic has been rather neglected so far and very short data exist about the changes with age in the relationship of body movements to sleep states: in both infants !!!REF!!! and young adults !!!REF!!!, body movements emerge from REM sleep more often than from other stages. To our knowledge, no similar data exist at present with regard to elderly subjects. Thus, a major aim of this study will be to clarify whether in the elderly body movements emerge from different sleep states compared to other age groups and whether they lead more frequently to sleep state changes and possibly to awakening.  A number of phasic events and periodic patterns make up sleep microstructure influencing sleep quality and the structure of NREM–REM sleep cycles. In the last years the evaluation of sleep has developed in particular by the detection of arousals, considered as major markers of sleep fragmentation, and by the analysis of cyclic alternating patterns (CAP), considered as indicators of sleep instability. According to the American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA), electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals are transient events characterized by “” !!!REF!!!. A certain number of spontaneous arousals seem to be an intrinsic component of physiological sleep !!!REFs!!!, but in case of sleep disorders they may become very frequent and associated with daytime sleepiness !!!REFs!!!. In some cases exogenous or endogenous stimuli promoting arousals may be identified whereas in other cases arousals may only be associated to variations of arousal level. Transient changes in EEG have been observed in association with vegetative modifications, such as modifications in heart rate and blood pressure: these EEG changes may be characterized by different patterns, including arousals, K-complexes and delta bursts. Such transient EEG patterns, emerging from the background activity, have often been observed to appear within a periodic structure, which has been described as CAP !!!REF!!!, a sequence of biphasic cycles, each composed of: phase A, composed of stereotyped EEG patterns and considered as an activation phase, which may include high voltage slow waves (synchronization) or low voltage fast waves (desynchronization); phase B, corresponding to the background activity separating two A phases. A set of standard criteria for CAP scoring has recently been presented !!!REF!!!, including the sub-typing of the phase A into A1, characterized by predominant slow waves, A2, in which slow waves are mixed with low voltage fast activities; and A3 in which fast activities and desynchronization are predominant. The relationship between arousals and CAP components has been explored by analyzing their distribution within overnight sleep !!!REF!!! and the respective correlation with age !!!REF!!!: arousals have been mainly found within CAP sequences and in particular in correspondence with the phases A2 and A3, which also were found to increase with age in a way similar to arousals. It has also been observed that ASDA arousals are often immediately preceded by K-complexes or short delta bursts !!!REFs!!!. The understanding of arousals, CAP and their relationship may take advantage by the use of quantitative EEG analysis in the frequency domain. The frequency changes associated to arousals have been explored with the main object of detecting arousals !!!REFs!!!, while Fourier analysis has been applied to compare the oscillations of band power profiles with CAP sequences !!!REFs!!!. The object of this study was the quantitative description of the EEG activities accompanying arousals explored in the time–frequency domain, with the main aim of verifying the association between short bursts of slow waves and the fast EEG activities setting up arousals. This study has been supplemented by the preliminary analysis of the time–frequency distribution of the EEG activities characterizing the different sub-types of the A phases within the cyclic alternating patterns.  Dream experience of patients with epilepsy seems of interest for a comprehensive account of dreaming as one of the outputs of a complex system of information processing during sleep !!!REFs!!!. The functioning of this system for dream production and recall has shown to be influenced not only by variations in the organization of sleep (i.e., stages and cycles: for review, see !!!REF!!!), but also by sleep disturbances (for example, sleep apnea and narcolepsy). Some alterations of sleep organization (such as the decrease of REM sleep, stages 3 and 4 of NREM Sleep and sleep efficiency, and the increase of stages 1 and 2 of NREM sleep) have been more frequently observed in patients with partial or generalized seizures than in healthy individuals. It seems thus legitimate to expect that the effectiveness of cognitive processes underlying dream production and recall varies with respect to the type and severity of epilepsy and presumably according to the brain areas affected by the disease. The hypothesis of a varying effectiveness of cognitive processes involved in the dream process of epileptic patients, which was suggested by early clinical observations (for review, see !!!REF!!!), has been recently strengthened by a dream-diary study. In this study the frequency of spontaneous morning recall of dream experience resulted much higher in patients with complex partial seizures (CPSs) than in those with generalized seizures (respectively, in about 55% versus 25% of days of the period considered !!!REF!!!). It is apparent that this hypothesis can be definitively corroborated only by laboratory data, namely by establishing the frequency and characteristics of dream experience of epileptic patients for all sleep stages. The data as yet available, however, is largely incomplete, given that dream experiences elaborated in NREM sleep have not been assessed. Thus, before any attempt to sketch a comprehensive account of the relationships between sleep disturbances and the functioning of cognitive processes involved in dreaming, some pieces of evidence are needed regarding the basic characteristics (such as frequency of recall and structural organization) of dream experiences reported after awakenings during NREM as well as REM sleep stages. We report here the results of a study on the effectiveness of the processes involved in dream experiences elaborated by patients with CPSs during REM and stage 2 NREM sleep. Patients with this type of epilepsy were chosen as supposed to be more likely to report dream experiences, according to the available data !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, the characteristics of NREM-dreams were probed in stage 2, as it is present in all cycles of sleep and with dream recall (DR) frequency (about 50%) close to that of other stages of NREM sleep in healthy individuals !!!REFs!!!. Finally, given the preliminary nature of the expected evidence, the patients sampled were without cognitive deficits or brain lesions observable from a CT scan, in order to avoid possible biases (respectively, global or hemisphere-related) in the elaboration or recall of dream experiences.  Driving simulators have been used to study the performance decrements associated with drowsiness. Variability of results may depend on the characteristics of simulator and driving scenario !!!REFs!!!. In order to validate a monotonous driving scenario, we correlated the results of a driving simulation task in different alertness conditions with objective (MSLT: Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and subjective (SSS: Stanford Sleepiness Scale; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale) sleepiness measurements.  Driving Simulators reproduce situations, requiring tracking and visual searching, the main features of real driving. Driving Simulators allow to analyze the consequences of different kinds of simulation tasks in conditions of excessive daytime sleepiness, when the alertness is decreased, without any risk for the subjects involved in the study !!!REFs!!!. Relative to these tasks, the major consequence of sleep deprivation is a decrement of driving performance, such as an interaction of the duration of sleep deprivation and the time of day. The aim of this study was to measure the reliability of a monotonous driving scenario to detect the circadian variations of alertness in healthy subjects. We tried to identify the most important driving parameter for evaluation of sleepiness.  We recently reported !!!REF!!! that computer-measured EMD in normal elderly subjects is significantly lower (by 39%) than in normal young adults. This result confirmed findings by Vegni et al. !!!REF!!! who used visual eye movement ratings and found reduced EMD in a combined group of “young old” and “old old” subjects. These data demonstrate that normal aging significantly affects the most prominent “phasic” component of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Tan et al. !!!REF!!! had previously established that the “tonic” component of REM sleep (i.e. the power spectrum of its low-voltage EEG) is also altered by age. Power in the low EEG frequencies of stage REM in the elderly is below that of young adults but is above the young adult level in higher frequencies; the cross-over takes place at about 8Hz. A similar age difference exists in the NREM spectra. There is some evidence that NREM delta and eye movement density varies inversely in response to experimental perturbations. For example, EMD is depressed by one night of total sleep deprivation and NREM delta production is increased !!!REFs!!!. In addition, delta declines and EMD tends to increase across sleep cycles !!!REF!!!. In a fundamentally important paper, Lucidi et al. !!!REF!!! showed that increasing sleep need with partial sleep deprivation systematically decreases EMD in recovery sleep. De Gennaro et al. !!!REF!!! deprived subjects of slow wave sleep keeping total sleep time constant. In recovery sleep, EMD was depressed in proportion to the amount of the slow wave sleep rebound. However, the EMD effect was not correlated with auditory awakening thresholds. While there appears to be a circadian influence on EMD, this effect is miniscule compared to the effects of prior sleep duration !!!REFs!!!. It therefore seemed of interest to determine whether the decrease in delta production produced by an afternoon nap would increase eye movement density and also whether EMD is correlated with NREM delta production in baseline sleep. Our previous report on EMD in the elderly used data from a study of naps in young and elderly subjects. Here, we used these same data to examine three questions: (1) is eye movement density in these two age groups inversely correlated with NREM delta production in baseline sleep? (2) is the reduction in NREM delta production following a late afternoon (1800) nap associated with an increase in EMD in post nap sleep? (3) do the trends across REM periods in computer-measured EMD in baseline sleep differ in the two groups and do any age differences depend on REM period 1?  Carnosine (β-alanyl-l-histidine) and its derivative anserine (β-alanyl-1-methyl-l-histidine) are present in high concentrations in the muscle and brain of mammalian and avian species !!!REFs!!!. The brain anserine concentration is particularly high (approximately 50μmol/100g) in day-old chicks !!!REF!!!. Thus, it can be predicted that carnosine-related dipeptides have some significant role in the chick brain. In the central nervous system (CNS), studies on localization of carnosine-related dipeptides show a complex pattern of expression that involves both neuronal and glial cell types. The glial localization, widely distributed throughout the whole brain and spinal cord, includes a subset of mature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whereas the neuronal localization is restricted to a particular type of neuron (the olfactory receptor neurons), and to a restricted population of putative migrating neurons and neuroblasts !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, carnosine has been characterized as a putative neurotransmitter in the olfactory receptor neurons !!!REF!!! and was implicated as having a possible role in neuron-glia cell interactions !!!REF!!!. It was previously reported that carnosine functions differently from constituents of carnosine in its calcium ion-releasing ability of the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle !!!REF!!!, vasodilatory effects !!!REF!!!, and antioxidant activity !!!REF!!!. Other reports revealed that carnosine functions as a reservoir of l-histidine (His) !!!REF!!!, or it functions the same as His in attenuation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG)-induced hyperglycemia !!!REF!!!. However, the functions of carnosine-related dipeptides in the brain have not been well investigated. Some reports indicate that glia cells may participate in behavioral control. Willoughby et al. !!!REF!!! reported that cerebral cortex injections of fluorocitrate, at a dose that inhibited astroglial metabolism selectively, induced seizures. Thus, locomotion may be affected by astroglial functions. The basomedial hypothalamus and area postrema react to changes in circulating glucose levels by altering feeding behavior and the secretion of pituitary and non-pituitary hormones. Young et al. !!!REF!!! investigated the precise identity of cells responding to glucose in these regions. They showed that astrocytes in these regions influenced the glucose-sensing function of the brain. Thus, the glia located in specific regions and carnosine in the glia may participate in the control of feeding behavior. As drugs are infused into the lateral ventricle of chicks, they barely diffuse into the olfactory bulb, but they diffuse into other brain regions including the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. Therefore, in order to further understand the action of carnosine-related dipeptides in the brain, particularly in the glia, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of carnosine, anserine, and constituents of carnosine, on behaviors in chicks.  γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, acts through three pharmacologically different receptor types, the ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors and the G protein-coupled GABAB receptors !!!REFs!!!. Because GABAC receptors are formed by specific ρ subunits !!!REFs!!!, the presence of ρ subunit protein or mRNA can be used as a marker for GABAC receptors. While GABAA and GABAB receptors are ubiquitously distributed, GABAC receptors are found only in a restricted number of CNS structures. GABAC receptors are densely expressed in the inner retina !!!REF!!! and in almost all retinorecipient nuclei of the subcortical visual system, including superior colliculus (SC), pretectal nuclear complex (PNC), and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; !!!REFs!!!). Apart from these visual structures, ρ subunits have also been identified in hippocampus, spinal cord, and cerebellum !!!REFs!!!. GABAC receptor function has been extensively studied in the retina where the receptor is strongly expressed in bipolar cell axon terminals !!!REFs!!!. Because GABAC receptors form ion channels permeable for Cl−, their activation reduces the light-induced signalling from bipolar cells to ganglion cells !!!REFs!!!. In the superficial layer of the SC, the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), GABAC receptors are selectively expressed by local GABAergic interneurons and their activation leads to disinhibition of SGS projection neurons !!!REFs!!!. In dLGN, local GABAergic interneurons also seem to express GABAC receptors. Electrical stimulation of afferents elicits inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in interneurons that are insensitive to GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists but that can be blocked with the selective GABAC receptor blocker (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA; !!!REF!!!). If in dLGN, similar to SC, GABAC receptor expression is restricted to GABAergic interneurons, activation of GABAC receptors reduces the inhibition of geniculocortical relay cells and increases their excitatory output. Although GABAC receptor mediated inhibition has been demonstrated qualitatively in dLGN interneurons, no quantitative estimation of the contribution of GABAC receptors to overall inhibition is available. Such an estimation, however, indicates the functional significance of GABAC receptors for intranuclear information processing. To get a more detailed view of GABAergic mechanisms in dLGN, we compared GABAergic currents in putative interneurons and geniculocortical relay cells and quantified the proportion of inhibitory currents mediated through GABAC receptors. We used acutely dissociated rat dLGN neurons and tried to identify GABAergic interneurons from their dendritic morphology in order to increase the sample of this cell type which make up only about 20% of all dLGN cells in rat !!!REFs!!!. Our results indicate that GABAC receptors are only present in interneurons and that they on average contribute to more than 25% of the maximum inhibitory currents. Thus, GABAC receptors have a significant functional significance for dLGN interneurons.  Substance P, neurokinin A and neurokinin B are small neuropeptides that act as ligands for three distinct G-protein coupled tachykinin receptors—NK1, NK2 and NK3 !!!REFs!!!. The NK3 receptor is a putative target for drugs affecting several psychiatric diseases !!!REF!!!, and NK3 receptors are located in many regions of the rat, guinea pig and gerbil brain, e.g. the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Several cortical areas in these species, including the frontal cortex, also express NK1 and NK3 receptors !!!REFs!!!. In humans NK3 receptors are present on pyramidal neurons and astrocyte-like cells in the prefrontal and visual cortex !!!REFs!!!. However, relatively few studies have investigated the electrophysiological effects of activation of tachykinin receptors on neurons in different cortical areas. In the rat entorhinal cortex substance P depolarizes GABAergic interneurons, layer V pyramidal neurons, and possibly excitatory interneurons, through activation of NK1 receptors !!!REFs!!!. Neurokinin B, through NK3 receptors, post-synaptically depolarizes pyramidal layer V neurons, which excite other layer V pyramidal neurons through local collateral axons !!!REF!!!. Here, senktide, which is a selective NK3 agonist !!!REF!!!, was used to investigate the actions of NK3 receptor activation in layer V and layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the gerbil cingulate cortex, which express a very high level of NK3 receptors !!!REF!!!.  Inflammatory pain is one of the most common types of pathological pain in clinical practice. Patients mainly suffer from the ongoing pain (spontaneous pain), evoked pain and hyperalgesia. Injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into a rat’s hind-paw provides a very good model in order to !!!REFs!!! study the mechanism of chronic inflammatory pain and to screen for anti-inflammatory hyperalgesic drugs. NMDA receptor antagonist such as ketamine !!!REF!!!, opioids !!!REF!!! and non-selective COX inhibitors !!!REF!!! are effective for the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain. However, after long-term application of these agents will produce some side effects. For instance, ketamine is a psychomimetic and can induce motor dysfunctions. Also, chronic administration of morphine will produce tolerance and dependency. These side effects limit their application in the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain. It has been reported that endogenous opioid systems has changed during inflammatory pain. For example, CFA that were induced into poly-arthritic rats displays a pronounced increase in the levels and synthesis of dynorphin B in the lumbar spinal cord, which might play a role in the modulation of nociception under chronic pain !!!REF!!!. CFA induced an up-regulation and increased membrane targeting of δ-opioid receptors in dorsal spinal cord !!!REF!!!. Taken together, these results may account for the efficacy of opioids on the CFA-induced inflammatory pain. Acupuncture has been used in China and Asian countries for more than 2000 years. Our previous studies have demonstrated that 2Hz EA mainly releases β-endorphin, endomorphin, and met-enkephalin, which take effects through activation of μ- and δ-opioid receptors; however, 100Hz EA mainly releases dynorphin, which plays a role through κ-opioid receptors !!!REF!!!. Since 15Hz is between 2 and 100Hz logarithmically, so 15Hz EA can release both endorphins and dynorphins in the central nervous system !!!REFs!!!. Electroacupuncture (EA, a modern version of traditional manual acupuncture) has shown to induce analgesia via accelerating the release of endogenous opioid peptides and their subsequent interaction with opioid receptors in normal rats and humans !!!REF!!!. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether single or repetitive administration of EA could reduce thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in a rat model with the use of CFA-induced inflammatory pain along with the possible mechanism concerning opioid involvement.  Relaxation of blood vessels can be mediated by several mechanisms, including cGMP, cAMP, and K+ channels !!!REF!!!. Membrane potential of vascular muscle is a major determinant of vascular tone, and activity of K+ channels is a major regulator of membrane potential !!!REFs!!!. Activation or opening of these channels increase K+ efflux, thereby producing hyperpolarization of vascular muscle. Membrane hyperpolarization closes voltage-dependent calcium channels and thereby causes relaxation of vascular muscle !!!REFs!!!. Direct measurements of membrane potential and K+ current in vitro indicate that several different types of K+ channels are present in cerebral blood vessels. In addition, a number of pharmacological studies using activators and inhibitors have provided functional evidence that K+ channels, especially ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) and calcium sensitive K+ (Kca) channels, regulate tone of cerebral blood vessels in vitro and in vivo !!!REF!!!. Some amino acids that function as neurotransmitters can play an important role in excitatory neural effects. Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter in the brain. It can bind to any of three different ionotropic receptor subtypes named after specific synthetic analogue: -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, and AMPA. Studies have shown that activation of NMDA receptors elicits cerebrovascular dilation and may couple blood flow to local cerebral metabolism !!!REF!!!. While the preponderance of experimental evidence favors nitric oxide (NO) as the mediator of NMDA-induced vasodilation in the brain !!!REFs!!!, recent studies suggest a role for P-450 expoxygenase products of arachidonic acid, adenosine, and carbon monoxide as potential mediators for such vasodilation as well !!!REFs!!!. However, the relationship between NMDA vasodilation and K+ channels has not been previously explored. Therefore, this study was designed to characterize the role of KATP and Kca channel activation in NMDA-induced pial artery dilation.  The three classes of opioid peptide neurotransmitters are derived from proteolytic processing of three propeptides. These are proenkephalin, which yields Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, and Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, prodynorphin, which yields dynorphin A(1–17), and pro-opiomelanocortin, which yields beta-endorphin. One additional class of opioid peptides, the four-amino acid endomorphins (endomorphin-l and endomorphin-2), have been isolated from brain tissue !!!REF!!!; however, neither a propeptide nor a gene has yet been identified, and the importance in the brain of this class of potent peptide agonists remains an open question. The three classes of opioid neuropeptides bind to and activate three classes of endogenous opioid receptors, the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors, which are encoded by three genes. Dynorphin A(1–17) binds preferentially to the kappa opioid receptor, while the enkephalins show relative selectivity for the delta and mu opioid receptors. Beta-endorphin is relatively selective for the mu opioid receptor, and, to a lesser extent, the delta opioid receptor. As an experimental model, the guinea pig may offer a kappa opioid receptor system more like the human than does the rat, and was therefore selected for the present study !!!REFs!!!. The sequence of the preprodynorphin gene has been reported for several species, including human and rat !!!REFs!!!. The porcine, rat, bovine, and mouse cDNA sequences have also been previously reported !!!REFs!!!. The structure of the guinea pig preprodynorphin mRNA has been previously deduced from a combination of a partial gene sequence and by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method !!!REF!!!. The preproenkephalin gene sequence has also been previously reported for several species, including human, rat, golden hamster, and guinea pig !!!REFs!!!. The human, rat, mouse, bovine, and golden hamster, and cDNA sequences have also been reported !!!REFs!!!. A variety of mechanisms have been shown to lead to species-, tissue-, and treatment-specific differences in the structure of preprodynorphin and preproenkephalin mRNA transcripts, and some of these different structural forms have impact on function. For example, in rat testis, alternative splicing of the preprodynorphin mRNA yields a mature mRNA that lacks exon 2. This exon codes for part of the 5′ untranslated region; the lack of this exon has no apparent effect on translational efficiency !!!REF!!!. Preproenkephalin mRNA is also abundantly expressed in the rat testis, but in a form that is approximately 300nt longer than that found in somatic tissues !!!REF!!!. It was subsequently shown that the longer testicular form is produced by initiation at several sites within the first intron (intron A) of the gene as it is expressed in other tissues. This longer form of the mRNA is largely translationally inactive, which is the likely explanation for low levels of enkephalin peptides in the testis, despite abundant mRNA expression !!!REFs!!!. In this report, we describe the isolation and sequences of multiple clones of guinea pig preprodynorphin and preproenkephalin cDNAs. These sequences revealed potential differences in mRNA transcription sites for the two prepropeptide mRNAs that had previously been predicted. RNase protection transcript mapping was then used to further characterize the different structural forms of the mRNA from the guinea pig brain and pituitary.  The technique of transplanting nerve cells into the striatum of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is currently under development. From a transplantation-immunological view, three sources of donor cells may be used autologous, allogeneic or xenogeneic, and pose increasing immunological challenges irrespective of the developmental or differentiation stage of the cells. Understanding the role of the immune-inflammatory reaction to grafting may play an important role in refining for brain repair in PD and other diseases. Clinical allotransplantation of human embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue transplanted to patients with PD can, in the best cases recorded, survive for more than 10 years, integrate into the host neural circuitry and effectively relieve symptoms with drastically reduced requirements of anti-parkinsonian medication, without development of side-effects !!!REF!!!. For embryonic neural tissue grafts in patients with PD to be highly effective, it is estimated that about 80–100,000 surviving dopaminergic neurons are needed in the putamen on one side !!!REF!!!. Current experimental protocols achieve at best 25–40% survival rate of implanted cells !!!REFs!!!, thus requiring four to eight human embryonic donors to obtain sufficient numbers for transplantation to one side !!!REF!!!. Logistic and ethical regards in donor tissue supply limit optimization of current protocols used for human allogeneic neurotransplantation. Post mortem analysis of recipients of human allogeneic grafts showed the presence of T-cells and activated microglia cells in and around the graft !!!REF!!!. Recently the observation of clinical deterioration following withdrawal of cyclosporine treatment in allotransplanted PD patients and the presence of dense microgliosis in recipients of multiple donor cell suspension has refueled the debate on the importance of immune reactions and immunosuppressive treatment in allogeneic neurotransplantation !!!REF!!!. Clinical xenotransplantation of porcine embryonic neural tissue to PD patients has been disappointing—though based on promising results obtained in studies of rodent models of PD !!!REFs!!!. Immunological rejection is the major limiting factor for neural xenografts to be applicable for clinical use. Efficient and specific immunosuppressive treatment protocols are required, since none of 12 patients with PD that received E26 old embryonic pig cells displayed objective signs of grafts survival on 18-F-dopa positron emission tomography scans !!!REF!!!. Consistent with this, only minor clinical improvements were reported !!!REF!!!; unpublished summary of phase II double-blinded study and poor survival rate of engrafted cells were found in a single case at autopsy after 7 months !!!REF!!!. Importantly, no evidence for transmission of pig-derived viruses was found !!!REFs!!! that is perceived as a serious and limiting risk factor !!!REFs!!!. The mechanisms that may lead to rejection or acceptance of neural allogeneic !!!REFs!!! or xenogeneic !!!REF!!! grafts are not fully understood and may involve different immune effector mechanisms during the rejection process. Cellular responses to neural grafts include mainly activated local microglia, blood-derived monocytes/macrophages, NK and NK-T cells, and T cells !!!REFs!!!. Experimentation suggests that in neural allotransplantation and xenotransplantation T-cell mediated immune responses are central to graft rejection, and that complement and immunoglobulins play a limited but not ignorable role !!!REFs!!!. The CD4+ population of T-cell can be divided into T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 subsets based on the effector function they facilitate !!!REFs!!!. The T-helper 1 subset of CD4+ T cells secrete IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-12, that lead to immune responses dominated by macrophages and probably microglia cells in the brain. IL-12 is an important cytokine promoter of IFN-γ secretion !!!REF!!!. The T-helper 2 subset of CD4+ T cells produce IL-4 and IL-10, that stimulate B-cell mediated immune responses including antibody reactions. The cytokines secreted exert counter regulatory effects as T-helper 1 cytokines down-regulate the expression of T-helper 2 cytokines and vice versa. Peripheral cellular allogeneic grafts give rise to a T-helper 1 associated response together with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells !!!REFs!!!. The immune response to cellular discordant xenografts implanted outside the CNS is characterized by mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by a T-helper 1 associated profile during the graft destruction, characterized by massive infiltration of macrophages accompanied by comparatively small numbers of CD4+ T-cells in the peripheral parts of the grafts !!!REF!!!. This response has many similarities with a delayed type hypersensitivity, DTH, reaction !!!REF!!!. In the CNS no typical DTH is induced following injection of the prototype agent (heat-killed bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG) used to induce a DTH reaction !!!REF!!!. However, at subsequent subcutaneous challenge with BCG a modified and down-regulated DTH response is induced at the site of the original BCG deposit within the CNS !!!REF!!!. The changes in the local microenvironment induced by transplantation of cells in to the diseased brain may be important in establishing cell survival and differentiation !!!REFs!!!. The importance of local factors in the brain, that may shape the immune-inflammatory reactions and the outcome of disease itself is becoming more and more evident !!!REFs!!!. Previous studies have addressed the role of cytokines in syngeneic !!!REFs!!!, concordant xenogeneic !!!REFs!!! or discordant xenogeneic neural grafts !!!REF!!!. Differences in the target sites, tissue preparation and implantation techniques, donor/recipient combinations, time points for survival and techniques for assessing cytokine expression make it difficult to compare studies. The aim of this study is to dissect the immunological mechanisms of graft rejection of neural tissue in the brain. We have used quantitative RT–PCR to quantify a variety of cytokine (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, IFN-γ and TNF-α) mRNA profiles in rats transplanted with syngeneic (SG), allogeneic (AG), concordant (CXG) or discordant (DXG) xenogeneic neural tissues. For the discordant xenografts, we also analyzed the histochemical expression pattern of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10 and TGF-β using immunohistochemistry, and in situ mRNA hybridization combined with unbiased stereological quantification. We demonstrate that in non-rejected allografts IL-4 expression was induced and that chronic inflammation is on going in the absence of a Th1 associated cytokines. Most CXG and DXG were rejected and displayed a Th1 associated response with high IFN-γ that may override a Th2 response and lead to chronic inflammatory reaction—reminiscent of a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction.  Recently, it has been showed that the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation can be modulated by complex psychological factors. For example, context-related cues, like verbal suggestions, can produce different outcomes following STN stimulation !!!REFs!!!. Similarly, awareness of being stimulated (open stimulation) or lack of awareness (hidden stimulation) induces different effects !!!REFs!!!. Context-related cues (verbal suggestions) have also been showed to induce a release of dopamine in the striatum of Parkinsonian patients !!!REF!!!, thus suggesting that the entire basal ganglia circuitry can be affected by psychological manipulation. The stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has long been known to induce an improvement of the motor symptoms in Parkinsonian patients !!!REFs!!!, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The Parkinsonian symptoms are known to be related to STN hyperactivity, and STN stimulation seems to induce a post-synaptic depolarization block and/or an activation of the afferent inhibitory fibers !!!REF!!!. The stimulation of the STN, and more in general of the subthalamic region, has been shown to produce not only motor-related responses, but also autonomic responses. For example, both electrical !!!REF!!! and glutamate !!!REF!!! stimulation of the zona incerta (ZI) induce cardiovascular responses in rats. Likewise, the electrical stimulation of the STN induces a conspicuous increase of heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate in freely moving cats !!!REF!!!. Recently, similar effects have been found in Parkinsonian patients who were implanted with electrodes in the STN !!!REFs!!!. The STN is known also to be related to associative and limbic functions !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, the stimulation of the human STN has been reported to produce emotional-related responses, such as euphoria and hypomania !!!REF!!!and mirthful laughter !!!REFs!!!, and the stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been found to induce acute depression !!!REFs!!!. In fact, the STN is connected to the ventral pallidum, a major limbic output region !!!REF!!!, and the temporal lobe is an output target of the basal ganglia !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, the activity of the cingulate cortex is modified by high-frequency STN stimulation !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the subthalamic region, which includes the ZI, STN and SNr, is a complex area where motor, associative, limbic, cardiovascular and autonomic functions are present. On the basis of these considerations, we performed an intraoperative microstimulation study of the subthalamic region in which either open or hidden stimulations were delivered at different sites, in order to better understand the characteristics and the distribution of the autonomic and emotional responses in the entire subthalamic area.  In a recent study, it has been shown that awake highly hypnotizable subjects are able to buffer the autonomic effects of a moderately unpleasant cognitive stimulation. Indeed, they exhibit an EEG pattern typical of a cognitive-emotional arousal without any change in heart rate (HR) and electrodermal tonic activity !!!REF!!!. The suppression of the autonomic output has been interpreted as an active mechanism related to the higher effectiveness of the frontal executive control system of hypnotizable subjects !!!REFs!!! that allows them to control their state of consciousness, perception and emotion through peculiar attentional/disattentional capabilities !!!REF!!!, suggesting that hypnotizable individuals could be naturally protected against the cardiac effects of acute stress. It has also been shown that hypnotized highly susceptible subjects, at variance with low hypnotizable ones, do not exhibit the effects of acute stress on peripheral vascular endothelial function !!!REF!!!. The endothelial function, that can be evaluated non-invasively as post-ischaemic flow-mediated vasodilation (%FMD) by brachial artery ultrasound, is transiently reduced by acute mental stress !!!REF!!!. This FMD dysfunction, which is known to outlast the stress with a peak after 10–90min, is likely due to the accumulation of endogenous catecholamines, endothelin-1 and angiotensin II !!!REFs!!! and has been considered a key pathophysiological variable in triggering cardiovascular events !!!REFs!!!. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess whether hypnotizability itself could prevent the effects of acute mental stress on endothelial function of awake hypnotizable and non-hypnotizable healthy subjects.  Behavioral studies of sleep and learning in humans and animals, and neurocognitive studies of information processing during sleep provide evidence for a relationship between sleep, learning and memory. The fact that some individuals can accomplish extraordinary memory feats is well-known. The scientific investigation of people with exceptional memory has been relatively neglected, with some remarkable exceptions !!!REF!!!. A recent study of a group of ten superior memorizers !!!REF!!! failed to detect differences in brain structure, as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging morphometry, in comparison to matched controls; however, a functional imaging study during a memory task indicated an increased recruitment of areas, such as the hippocampal formation, engaged in spatial memory. The latter finding was interpreted as reflecting the use of specific strategies involving spatial learning by superior memorizers. We have had the opportunity to collaborate with one superior memorizer in the investigation of the psychological and neurological correlates of his exceptional performances. Given the evidence for a relationship between sleep and memory performance !!!REF!!!, as part of the evaluation we performed a polysomnographic study. In our evaluation we included the arousals that interrupt sleep continuity. The scoring of arousals relies on transient EEG changes mostly characterized by patterns of wakefulness. However, in this standard scoring the abrupt appearance of slow wave activities is basically neglected, even if it has been demonstrated that autonomic changes may occur in concomitance with these EEG changes. In recent years, some authors have identified the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) that is involved in the structural organization of non-REM sleep. CAP is identified by repetitive stereotyped EEG patterns lasting 10–60s and separated by time-equivalent intervals of background activity !!!REFs!!!. CAP corresponds to a prolonged oscillation of the arousal level between two reciprocal functional states termed phase A (greater arousal; clusters of EEG transients) and phase B (lesser arousal; interval between the successive clusters); the complementary condition non-CAP is closely related to a degree of stability in sleep depth. We report here the polysomnographic results obtained in our superior memorizer.  Histamine H3 receptor was first discovered by Arrang et al. !!!REF!!! as a presynaptic autoreceptor regulating the release and synthesis of histamine from the central histaminergic neurons. Thereafter, a number of histamine H3 receptor-selective ligands have been developed including the agonist, (R)-α-methylhistamine and the antagonist, thioperamide. There have been some reports that H3 receptor agonists and antagonists showed a variety of pharmacological activities in the central nervous system. For instance, H3 receptor has been reported to be responsible for sleep/wakefulness, cognition/memory, epilepsy and obesity !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of H3 receptor agonists or antagonists in a variety of pathological situations have received much attention and many potent selective agonists and antagonists have been synthesized. Regardless of many efforts, none of the drugs has yet been approved for clinical use. We have reported that H3 antagonist, thioperamide, caused an inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures in rats, and the possibility of new types of antiepileptics has been demonstrated !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, it has been found that the affinity of H3 receptor for iodophenpropit is more potent than that for thioperamide !!!REF!!!. In this study, we studied the effect of iodophenpropit on amygdaloid kindled seizures in rats.  Thyroid hormones exert a crucial role on trophic events of the central nervous system during development, adulthood, and ageing. The lack of thyroid hormones leads to a dramatic impairment of mental performance !!!REF!!!. In particular, hypothyroidism, induced postnatally, has been associated with a decrease in the expression of structural proteins like tubulin !!!REF!!! and with neurochemical alterations in the brain caused by a different metabolic regulation !!!REF!!!. Thyroid hormones also have a complex action on the mature brain, either by a regulation of direct gene expression or through some general biochemical and metabolic adjustments, including changes in mRNA stability, protein degradation, and energy balance !!!REFs!!!. The hippocampus, which has been postulated to be involved in the process of epileptogenesis, is particularly affected by hypothyroidism. Reductions in the total number of granular cells in the dental gyrus and in the pyramidal cells of CA3 have been reported in hypothyroid rats !!!REFs!!!. The deficiency of thyroid hormones also produce a deficiency of Na+,K+-ATPase in the brain !!!REF!!!, which could produces alterations in the excitatory pathways of the hippocampus because the uptake of glutamate into glial cells and neurons in the central nervous system shows a sodium-gradient dependence !!!REF!!!. Kainic acid (KA) is a well-known agonist of glutamate receptors and has convulsant properties !!!REF!!!. Seizures induced by KA are followed by severe selective neuron damage in the CA3 hippocampal region !!!REF!!!. Administration of KA, leading to prolonged seizures, causes an increase in the progenitor-cell division in the dentate gyrus !!!REF!!!. Because of this, we wished to determine if hypothyroidism modifies the effects of KA on CA3 pyramidal cells.  Many structural and neurochemical changes have been reported to occur with human aging !!!REF!!!. Age-related losses have been found in dendritic arborization, synaptic density and postsynaptic markers of the hippocampal formation and neocortex !!!REFs!!!, and neuronal loss has been noted in the substantia nigra and other regions !!!REF!!!. Brain atrophy, associated with increased sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, has been demonstrated in the elderly by means of computer assisted tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) !!!REFs!!!. Regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) and for oxygen, as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), are markers of brain functional activity. Glucose is oxidized in brain to synthesize ATP to maintain neuronal function, and rCBF is coupled to rCMRglc !!!REF!!!. These parameters, which can be measured in humans with positron emission tomography (PET), generally have been reported to decline significantly with age (reviewed in !!!REFs!!!). Age declines have been noted in rCBF in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex !!!REF!!! and in other brain regions !!!REF!!!, and decreased brain oxygen consumption also has been reported !!!REFs!!!. Decreased rCMRglc with aging has been reported in frontal !!!REF!!!, parietal and temporal regions !!!REF!!!. Some reported age reductions may have reflected concurrent disease processes, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, or diabetes !!!REFs!!!, which were not always scrupulously screened for (reviewed in !!!REFs!!!). Additionally, rCMRglc and rCBF are sensitive to visual and auditory stimulation !!!REFs!!!. Because visual and auditory acuities decline with age !!!REFs!!!, PET studies not performed in a “resting” state (eyes covered and ears plugged) can reflect age changes in peripheral visual and auditory inputs to brain rather than in intrinsic brain function. Nevertheless, even when performed in the “resting” state on normotensive, optimally healthy subjects, significant declines in PET-derived brain glucose metabolism of the order of 8–12% have been reported between 20 and 80 years of age !!!REFs!!!. It also has been recognized that age-related brain atrophy, accompanied by increased CSF spaces, will reduce rCBF or rCMRglc calculated per volume of interest (voxel) in a PET scan, due to an increased fraction of non-metabolizing CSF in this volume. An algorithm has been developed to correct PET metabolic or flow data for this partial volume effect (PVE) !!!REFs!!!. A PET study of 27 healthy men and women between the ages of 19 and 76 years demonstrated that calculated age reductions in mean cortical CBF were statistically significant in the absence of a PVE correction, but not after this correction !!!REF!!!. In contrast, in normotensive patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with age matched healthy controls, we reported widespread significant rCMRglc reductions both before and after (although quantitatively less) a PVE correction !!!REF!!!. In a subsequent study, a PVE correction also did not eliminate statistical significant reductions in rCMRglc in posterior brain regions of a visual variant of Alzheimer’s disease !!!REF!!!. These results are consistent with “intrinsic” neuropathology involving reduced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the postmortem Alzheimer’s disease brain !!!REFs!!!, and with statistically significant correlations between cognitive and behavioral reductions in non-PVE corrected rCMRglc in living Alzheimer’s disease patients !!!REFs!!!. To see if an increased PVE also could account for age-related declines in PET derived brain glucose metabolism, in the present study we determined “resting state” CMRglc and rCMRglc using PET in two groups of young and older normotensive healthy men. We chose to study only men to reduce possible gender related variability in our data !!!REFs!!!. We calculated CMRglc and rCMRglc in different brain regions, before and after making a PVE correction with the algorithm that we used in our Alzheimer’s disease studies (see above) !!!REFs!!!. Briefly, we found that PVE uncorrected rCMRglc was reduced significantly in the older group in several brain regions, whereas statistically significant differences were absent after a correction. An abstract of part of this work has been presented !!!REF!!!.  Metallothionein (MT)-III isoform is a metal-binding protein expressed in the brain !!!REF!!!. Like MT-I+II, MT-III binds zinc with high affinity !!!REF!!!. MT-III prevents aberrant neuronal sprouting and neurofibrillary tangles !!!REF!!! and contributes to intracellular defence against reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species !!!REF!!!. As a consequence, MT-III can limit neuronal cell death !!!REF!!!. MT-III protects CA3 neurons of the hippocampus from seizure-induced damage !!!REF!!!, as reported for MT-I+II !!!REF!!!. This protection occurs during a transient stress because MT-III releases zinc through MT degradation in lysosomes !!!REF!!!, and zinc is indispensable for some zinc-dependent antioxidant enzyme activities, such as that of superoxide dismutase in the brain !!!REF!!!, for DNA repair !!!REF!!! and for synaptic transmission !!!REF!!!. Previous studies reported that the zinc content in some brain areas does not change in young stressed mice, and MT-III increments are independent from zinc !!!REFs!!!. This conclusion, however, may be misleading because MT-I+II and MT-III are multifunctional zinc-binding proteins, but with compensatory phenomena between them in the brain !!!REF!!! without any modification of the intracellular zinc content !!!REFs!!!. Interleukin (IL)-6 induces MT-III mRNA following stress and inflammation !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, stressed IL-6 null mice display decreased MT-III mRNA and enhanced inflammation !!!REFs!!!. It is also of interest that high IL-6 is coupled with low zinc ion bioavailability during inflammation !!!REF!!!. These findings suggest the occurrence of close interrelationships among IL-6, MT-III, zinc ion bioavailability and inflammation. The MT-III homeostasis is therefore crucial for zinc turnover within the brain against inflammation. In ageing, persistent high levels of IL-6 lead to a chronic status of inflammation, which is represented by a concomitant dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines production, such as IL-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, by immune cells, further exacerbated by age-associated pathologies !!!REF!!!. IL-6 is also produced in the brain by astrocytes, microglia and neurons !!!REF!!! and increases in the aged mouse brain !!!REF!!!. Even if the functions of IL-6 in the central nervous system during ageing are not fully established, the chronically elevated IL-6 amplifies its own production via autocrine induction, leading to an up-regulation of the inflammatory process in the brain !!!REF!!!. MTs sequester more zinc ions than copper during ageing !!!REF!!!. Elevated concentrations of zinc-bound MT-III have been found in the hippocampus of old mice !!!REF!!! and dogs !!!REF!!!. Others studies have reported that MT-III-immunopositive cells and basal expression of MT-III mRNA increase in the frontal cortex from old rats !!!REF!!!. However, it was reported in the same study !!!REF!!! that no MT-III induction occurs in the aged rat brain after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Even if the latter finding may seem contradictory with respect to the other data, the findings overall suggest that high MT-III may not play a protective role in chronic inflammation because high zinc-bound MT-III may lead to low free zinc ion bioavailability !!!REF!!!, which is needed for the maintenance of key functions in the brain !!!REFs!!!. In some brain areas (hippocampus, frontal cortex and temporal cortex), MT-III is not impaired !!!REF!!! or down-regulated !!!REFs!!! during neurodegeneration, which is a condition characterised by persistent high levels of IL-6 !!!REF!!!, chronic brain inflammation !!!REF!!! and low zinc ion bioavailability !!!REF!!!. This may lead to a decreased number of synapses, whose function is zinc-dependent !!!REF!!! and impaired in ageing !!!REF!!!. The concomitant increments of zinc-bound MT-I+II in the aged brain !!!REF!!! and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases !!!REF!!! may lead to marked low zinc ion bioavailability. The presence of compensatory phenomena between MT isoforms in the brain !!!REF!!!, therefore, suggests the importance of studying at the same time both MT isoforms, in order to better understand their role in the aged brain. On this basis, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role played by MT-III and MT-I+II on the number of synapses in the hippocampus of old rats in relation to inflammation (i.e., to IL-6 turnover) and zinc content in the hippocampus, as well as zinc ion bioavailability. This latter parameter was tested with the ratio total thymulin/active thymulin (TT/AT) !!!REF!!!.  Quantitative morphometric studies of the human cerebral cortex are important for the characterisation of the normal cytoarchitecture and its involvement in experimental and neuropathological processes in which the number, density, size, shape, or clustering of cells may be affected. Most cytoarchitectural investigations use conventional staining of the Nissl substance with cresyl violet. This has the advantage of ease and familiarity of use, and robustness across a range of fixation and processing conditions. The fact that it stains both neurons and glia is often advantageous, but it is a disadvantage in that small neurons may be misclassified as glia, or vice versa. NeuN is an antibody which recognises a neuron-specific antigen and which selectively and clearly stains neuronal perikarya and nuclei !!!REF!!!. Since being proposed as a neuronal marker suitable for post-mortem brain tissue !!!REF!!!, NeuN has been used in an increasing number of studies. It has found a niche in studies of neurogenesis and development when neuronal phenotype needs to be demonstrated (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). It is also being used in studies of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) and experimental lesions (e.g. !!!REFs!!!), situations where the proliferation or hypertrophy of glia increases the potential for confusion with small neurons. A similar problem of uncertain cellular identity may affect neuropathological studies of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, since reductions in the size and density of both glia and neurons has been described in Nissl stained material !!!REFs!!!. To our knowledge, no studies have directly compared Nissl with NeuN staining for estimation of the neuronal morphometric parameters most often measured in the human cerebral cortex: neuronal density and neuronal size. As the two stains are increasingly being used interchangeably, it is important to have this information. This study was intended to fill this gap. To do so we chose to study the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; area 24). First, since there are already relatively detailed qualitative !!!REFs!!! and some quantitative !!!REFs!!! data using cresyl violet. Second, since it is the cortical area in which many of the morphometric alterations in schizophrenia !!!REF!!! and mood disorder !!!REF!!! mentioned above have been reported. Although neuronal shape has not been studied in the ACC, it is altered in the hippocampus !!!REF!!! and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (unpublished observations) in schizophrenia, and was therefore also measured.  Postural control is known to result from the integration of visual, somesthesic and vestibular information (e.g. !!!REF!!!). In addition, evidence that postural control requires attentional resources has been shown by recent studies using a dual-task paradigm (see !!!REF!!! for a review). In general, results showed that even tasks considered automated and/or involving lower order operations require some attentional resources. Further, a common observation of these studies is that the attentional demand associated with postural control is modified by several factors such as injuries !!!REFs!!!, pathologies !!!REF!!!, aging !!!REFs!!!, the difficulty of the postural task !!!REFs!!!, or the availability of the sensory information !!!REFs!!!. Although we know that sport practice can have an influence on postural control (e.g. !!!REFs!!!), it remains unclear, however, whether the dependency on attentional processes for controlling posture can be modified with individuals who are trained to face high postural constraints. For instance, performing acrobatics and complex chained dynamic choreographic figures, similar to those involved in gymnastics, places great demand on the postural control system. Expert gymnasts are thus trained to maintain and to restore both static and dynamic balance in challenging conditions and it is possible that the attentional demand necessary for efficiently controlling posture is modulated through a specific training such as gymnasts do. Hence, rendering postural control less cognitively dependent may allow the gymnasts to pay more attention to other components of their performance. These findings maybe important for better understanding the organizational principles that determine the allocation of attentional resources for regulating postural sway during quiet stance. The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the attentional demand necessary for regulating postural sway during quiet standing, using a dual-task paradigm, in expert gymnasts and experts in other non-gymnastics sports. In order to determine whether the difficulty of the postural task can help to differentiate the performance of both groups, subjects were tested in three different postures of increasing difficulty (bipedal, unipedal and unipedal on an unstable support). It was hypothesized that (1) the attentional demand necessary for regulating postural sway increased as the difficulty of the postural task increased, and (2) this effect was smaller for the gymnasts than for the non-gymnasts.  Mirtazapine {1,2,3,4,10,14-hexa-hydro-2-meth-ylpyrazino[2,1-]pyrido[2,3-]benzazepin} is a tetracyclic compound with antidepressant activity in human !!!REFs!!!. Mirtazapine has a unique mechanism of action, different from that of the classical tricyclic antidepressants, the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and could be described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, abbreviated as NaSSA !!!REF!!!. The pharmacological profile of mirtazapine is characterized by potent presynaptic α2-adrenergic antagonistic activity, 5-HT1 agonistic activity, and potent 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonistic activities, as well as by a potent H1 antagonistic activity !!!REF!!!. The blockade of presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors is considered as a possible mechanism for antidepressant activity of mirtazapine. The interactions of mirtazapine with 5-HT receptors were studied in vivo in experiments measuring selective 5-HT receptor subtype-mediated behaviors !!!REF!!!. Mirtazapine was found to induce lower lip retraction mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in rats !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the taste aversion induced by mirtazapine was also prevented by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di--propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), indicating similar stimulus properties of mirtazapine and 8-OH-DPAT !!!REF!!!. This indicates that mirtazapine exerts in vivo effects mediated by 5-HT1A receptor without high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. There is to date no clear evidence that mirtazapine enhances 5-HT1A neurotransmission. The frontal cortex has been repeatedly proposed as an area involved in depression, since positron emission tomography studies revealed that depressed patients show functional changes in the frontal cortex !!!REFs!!!. It has been suggested that the property of stimulating dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex has a role in the antidepressant action !!!REFs!!!. In light of these observations, the aims of the study reported here were to assess the effects of mirtazapine on dialysate levels of dopamine and 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of freely moving rats and to determine whether this drug could modulate 5-HT1A neurotransmission.  Numerous studies have addressed the neural substrate of spatial navigation and place learning in the rat. Such studies have utilized a broad variety of experimental designs focusing on various aspects of the behavioural and cognitive processes. While attempting to solve navigational tasks the animals may engage a variety of behavioural strategies (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). It is assumed that each solution strategy has a unique neural substrate. The neural substrate of each strategy is probably composed of several neural structures, while each structure may contribute to the neural substrate of multiple strategies (e.g. !!!REF!!!). Performance of different variants of a particular behavioural task seem to be mediated by dissimilar neural substrates—presumably reflecting a situation in which exposure to a particular task variant favours the selection and application of a particular solution strategy (or combination of solution strategies) (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). A somewhat related view is expressed in the hypotheses of Poucet !!!REF!!!. In the most commonly applied water maze setup for studies of place learning by rats (e.g. !!!REF!!!), the swimming animal has a free view of the room surrounding the water maze—a room in which an abundance of three-dimensionally arranged visual cues are offered. Normal rats presented with such a situation appear predominantly to apply an allocentric spatial “mapping” or “locale” strategy (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). The neural substrate of such a strategy appears to include major contributions from the hippocampal formation (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) as well as the cholinergic system (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). To what extent the anteromedial prefrontal cortex of the rat contributes to the mediation of such an allocentric mapping strategy remains undecided. While some experiments demonstrate prefrontally ablated rats to show a major impairment of the acquisition and/or performance of what appears to be “standard” place learning tasks in water mazes (to the extent any such standard exists) !!!REFs!!!, other studies utilizing largely similar experimental setups and behavioural procedures find onlyminor or even absent impairments after similar lesions (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). A possible explanation of such conflicting results might be that although experimental setups and procedures appear to be largely similar across studies, the minor procedural and/or environmental reported (and potentially unreported) differences may have been associated with selection of dissimilar solution strategies by the subjects across studies. Even when a significantly impaired task performance has been observed after lesions of the hippocampal formation or the prefrontal cortex, additional training enables most lesioned animals to reach a task proficiency which is indistinguishable from that of control animals (e.g. !!!REF!!!). It may be hypothesised that such a behavioural recovery process is achieved by the selection of a solution strategy (or cluster of strategies) which is not primarily applied by the normal animal—and which is mediated by a neural substrate that remains undisturbed in the lesioned animal. Presently, we will use the term “recovery” in such cases—even though it might be argued, that one should rather speak of compensatory processes. In a series of experiments we modified the visual environment of the water maze in such a way that the “distal” visual cues were limited to four two-dimensional geometric patterns mounted on the inner surface of a circular curtain spanning the circumference of the maze. Under such circumstances, the behavioural impairments induced by rotational displacements of the cues demonstrated that the rats discriminated between the cues and utilised the cues for navigational purposes (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). The effect of various lesions and pharmacological interventions demonstrated that the acquisition of a place learning task with such an experimental setup is mediated by a neural substrate dissimilar to that of task acquisition within the above mentioned “standard” water maze setup (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). It has been suggested that the modified stimulus configuration increases the likelihood that normal rats select other navigation strategies than those applied in the standard experimental setup. Such alternative strategies have been termed “non-mapping” strategies, and it has been suggested that those strategies depend on neural substrates differing from those mediating the allocentric mapping (or locale) strategies normally seen in the standard place learning design !!!REFs!!!. If the available distal visual cues are modified as described above, hippocampal and cholinergic contributions to the mediation of task solution are de-emphasised to such a degree that the task acquisition remains unimpaired by transection of the fimbria-fornix or systemic administration of the selective muscarinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine (in the dosage of 0.5mg/kg) !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, this variant of the place learning task is profoundly impaired by ablation of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex !!!REF!!!. The “non-mapping” place learning may be related to the “response learning” or “egocentric” spatial orientation shown to depend heavily on prefrontal cortical mediation (e.g. !!!REFs!!!; Mogensen et al., in preparation). It should, however, be noted that “response learning” and egocentric spatial orientation are demonstrated in situations where distal visual cues are absent or made irrelevant for navigational purposes. In contrast, place learning of the “non-mapping” type does rely on “distal” visual cues for navigational purposes (as repeatedly demonstrated !!!REFs!!!). Working to elucidate the potential differences between the neural substrates of a particular task solution in normal rats and in animals which have undergone a functional recovery after a mechanical trauma of the brain and/or a more or less permanent inhibition of a neurochemical system, we have developed techniques of pharmacological and surgical challenges. In such challenges, neurochemical or structural systems are temporarily or chronically inactivated while task performance is being assessed in recovered individuals as well as in normal controls (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Such challenges have for instance been able to demonstrate that structurally as well as neurochemically different neural substrates mediate allocentrically based place learning in rats who have acquired the task with and without availability of the nitric oxide synthesizing enzyme !!!REFs!!!. As mentioned above, such a reorganization of the neural substrate of task mediation in recovered animals may, at a cognitive and/or behavioural level, be characterized by a shift within the relative importance of various behavioural strategies. Potentially, it could reflect a situation in which normal animals apply the “normally preferred strategy” (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) while recovered rats primarily apply an alternative behavioural strategy. An alternative explanation of the modification of the neural substrate of task mediation may be that identical strategies are applied by normal and recovered animals and that after the recovery process such a strategy is mediated by different neural substrates (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). While studies of the neural substrate of task mediation in normal and recovered rats may further elucidate the neural reorganisations associated with behavioural and functional recovery, only studies directly addressing the behavioural deficits of task performance will be able to distinguish between the two hypotheses—emphasising selection of alternative strategies or reacquisition of the normally applied strategy, respectively. If functional compensation or recovery after brain damage relies partially or fully on reorganisations of the neural substrate of task mediation, it might be possible that pharmacological support of certain alternative or compensatory neural substrates could provoke, enhance or complete the processes of functional recovery. Studies addressing the effects of various brain lesions have in a number of instances demonstrated that administration of certain pharmacological agents to brain damaged individuals may be associated with reduced or eliminated symptoms of the brain damage in question (e.g. !!!REFs!!!; Holm and Mogensen, in preparation). During the postoperative performance of a task administered in a 5-unit linear maze M’Harzi et al. !!!REF!!! found the performance of fimbria-fornix transected rats to benefit significantly from mild catecholaminergic stimulation. When suffering unilateral ablations of the anteromedial prefrontal or parietal association cortex rats demonstrate a transient pattern of neglect-like symptoms affecting the contralateral hemispace (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). The functional recovery of such unilaterally lesioned rats appears to be potentiated by systemic administration of the direct dopaminergic agonist apomorphine (!!!REF!!!; Holm and Mogensen, in preparation). The present study addressed aspects of the neural substrates of an allocentric place learning task by rats in a water maze allowing a free view of the experimental room within which distal visual cues were arranged three-dimensionally. We also studied the neural substrates of post-traumatic recovery processes for such a task in rats given transections of the fimbria-fornix or ablations of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex. We decided to study four experimental groups: animals in which the fimbria-fornix had been transected, animals in which the total anteromedial prefrontal cortex had been ablated, animals subjected to a “sham” (control) operation during which no damage was inflicted upon the brain and a “combined lesion” group in which the fimbria-fornix had been transected and the total anteromedial cortex had been ablated. To our knowledge, acquisition of a place learning task has never before been studied in rats with simultaneous lesions of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and the fimbria-fornix. In attempts to compare the neural substrates of task performance of the four experimental groups after the recovery period, the task performance of all subjects was studied after administration of a number of pharmacological challenges. The challenges consisted of administration of the muscarinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0.5mg/kg) and a high dosage of the indirect catecholaminergic agonist d-amphetamine (3.0mg/kg). Such a dosage of d-amphetamine is believed to render the catecholaminergic systems dysfunctional by hyperactivation. Additionally, we decided to expose all groups to a low dosage of d-amphetamine (0.3mg/kg) in order to examine whether any lesioned group would benefit from such a mild stimulation of the catecholaminergic systems (see above)—especially the fimbria-fornix transected group might be expected to show therapeutic effects of such a treatment (see !!!REF!!!). Additionally, the performance of all groups was examined on a probe trial during which no platform was present in the water maze. In a previous study, utilising a place learning design similar to the one presently addressed we examined the effects of a retention pause lasting 21 days !!!REF!!!. After reaching asymptotic task performance behavioural changes across a 21-day long pause were studied in a group in which the total anteromedial prefrontal cortex had been ablated prior to task acquisition and a group which had been subjected to sham surgery. Comparing the last pre-pause session to the first post-pause session, we found the sham operated control group to have significantly increased swim distances as well as swim durations. In contrast, similar comparisons within the prefrontally ablated group demonstrated significant reductions (“improvements”) on two parameters: the percentage swim time spent in the outer maze centred annulus and the mean distance to platform. In the present study, we wanted to examine whether these observations of an apparently modified swim pattern of prefrontally ablated rats across a retention pause could be reproduced. Consequently, the design of the present study included a post-acquisition pause of at least 31 days. The present study also allowed tests of potential pause-related behavioural effects in fimbria-fornix transected and combined lesion animals. The functions of the hippocampus and to an extent even prefrontal cortex of the rat are often discussed in the context of spatial orientation and/or learning, memory, and problem solving within the spatial domain [for references: see above]. In order to compare directly the outcome of the main (spatial) task of the present study to the performance of the same animals in a task in which spatial orientation plays little or no role, we also subjected the four experimental groups to an exploration based test of object recognition (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). In this test object recognition is evaluated entirely on the basis of spontaneous exploration and neither acquisition nor retention of an experimental rule is required. The test utilizes the tendency of rats to primarily explore novel rather than previously encountered objects. The level of “recognition” of an object to which the animal has previously been exposed is therefore reflected in the degree of exploration of such an object relative to the exploration of a novel one. The test has been proposed as a “rat alternative” to the trial unique non-matching-to-sample test in monkeys !!!REFs!!!. The presently utilised object recognition test is clearly a rather pure test of episodic memory for objects—some even claim it to be a one-trial test of “working memory for objects” in rats. In recent years, there has been a reappraisal of the roles played by the hippocampal formation and related cortical areas (parahippocampal, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex) in various forms of learning and memory. Studies utilising selective lesions in monkeys point to a functional dissociation between these structures—the rhinal and parahippocampal cortex being more important for object memory while the hippocampal formation proper apparently is more heavily involved in mediation of spatial memory (e.g. !!!REFs!!! see, however, !!!REF!!!). Studies of the spontaneous object recognition test in rats subjected to lesions within various parts of the hippocampal system have yielded conflicting results. Lesions of the hippocampus proper or transections of the fimbria-fornix have been found to leave spontaneous object recognition intact in some studies—while impairments in such tests were seen in two studies utilising ischemic damage of the hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. After lesions of the rhinal and perirhinal cortex of the rat, spontaneous object recognition has consistently been reported to be impaired !!!REFs!!!. The prefrontal cortex of the monkey is frequently discussed as a structure which may contribute to the mediation of one-trial specific memory for objects. It has been suggested that prefrontal contributions to mediation of working memory are specialised in such a way that the areas surrounding the sulcus principalis are primarily involved in mediation of visuo-spatial processing while the cortex of the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex is primarily involved in mediation of object related processing (e.g. !!!REF!!!). In rats, however, lesions of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex (which is believed to be at least partly homologous to the monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (e.g. !!!REF!!!)) have failed to impair the presently discussed spontaneous object recognition test !!!REFs!!!. On the background of existing studies addressing the effects of lesions within the hippocampal and prefrontal systems of rats on the performance of the spontaneous object recognition test it seemed relevant to test the four experimental groups of the present study on such a task. To our knowledge, such a test has never been applied to animals subjected to combined lesions of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and the fimbria-fornix.  Maternal behavior in the rat consists of maternal nest building, and pup directed behaviors including retrieving, nursing, grooming, and protection from intruders. Parturient females are immediately maternally responsive to their pups. Less generally known is that fact that female, male, or juvenile rats can be induced to express maternal behavior by continuous exposure to new born pups provided from parturient female foster mothers. The expression of pup-induced maternal behavior has been studied extensively; it is virtually indistinguishable from hormonally-induced maternal behavior, except that parturient females nurse their pups. !!!REFs!!!. Adult rats (>60 days of age) require 4–8 days of exposure to pups before maternal behavior emerges, while surprisingly young juvenile rats (20–26 days of age) only require 1–3 days of exposure to pups. This required exposure period increases as the juveniles approach puberty !!!REFs!!!. These data suggest an intriguing difference in behavioral responsiveness across young juveniles and adults. Key components of the neural circuit that mediate maternal behavior include the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the medial and cortical amygdala (MCA), and the nucleus accumbens (NAC), along with other limbic and hypothalamic structures !!!REF!!!. Most of our knowledge of the neural circuit that mediates maternal behavior has been gathered from studies using adult animals; much less has been done using the juvenile. The MPOA is necessary for both the expression of and motivation to perform maternal behavior !!!REF!!!. In adults both large and very small lesions in the MPOA disrupt maternal behavior while in the juvenile or pubertal rat, only large lesions disrupt the behavior, small lesions do not !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, increased expression of immunoreactive c-fos in the MPOA and other components of this neural circuit occurs in adults during pup-induced maternal behavior, however, in juveniles c-fos induction depends upon the age of the juveniles and perhaps on the extent of pup exposure !!!REFs!!!, suggesting that this is a maturing circuit component. In the non-maternal adult female, neuronal activity in the MCA inhibits maternal behavior by a mechanism that involves processing of olfactory cues from the initial exposure to pups !!!REFs!!!. The hormones of the peripartum period are thought to alter or release this basal inhibition so that the expression of maternal behavior can occur. Prolonged pup exposure also reduces this basal inhibition allowing the onset of pup-induced maternal behavior. Lesions in the medial amygdala had similar effects in both older juveniles and adults, shortening the time of pup exposure needed to induce maternal behavior !!!REF!!!. The NAC is necessary for retrieval components of maternal behavior, and for processing of pup related stimuli likely to be related to mechanisms of motivation in the adult, not yet studied in the juvenile !!!REF!!!. The scope of our knowledge concerning the neurotransmitters that mediate maternal behavior is limited to a few transmitters and to the adult model !!!REF!!!. The literature provides the clearest case for a role for dopamine (DA) in the mediation of maternal behavior !!!REFs!!!. Extensive lesions of the dopaminergic system !!!REFs!!! disrupt maternal behavior, and dopamine receptor antagonists infused locally into the NAC inhibited retrieval and licking components of maternal behavior !!!REF!!!. These studies suggest that expression of the behavior requires dopamine. Increases in DA and DA metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the extracellular space in the ventral striatum after separated mother rats and pups were reunited !!!REF!!! suggest a role in the motivational components of the behavioral response. The exploration of a role for other neurotransmitters in the mediation of maternal behavior is very limited; however, there is modest evidence that serotonin (5-HT) may be involved. Barofsky et al. !!!REF!!! found that serotonergic lesions in the median raphe nucleus caused short-term disruption in maternal behavior but not the prolactin response with suckling, however, the study does not establish functional specificity since locomotor impairment was not ruled out. Ferreira et al. !!!REF!!! found that buspirone (a partial 5-HT1A agonist) inhibited maternal behavior; however, they did find reduced motor activity, limiting the specificity of the interpretation. Microdialysis also showed an increase in the concentration of the metabolite for 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA), in the ventral striatum when dams were reunited with pups !!!REF!!!; perhaps motivational components of maternal behavior are supported by this system as well. Infusions of cocaine into the NAC or MPOA disrupt adult maternal behavior !!!REF!!!; suggesting the exact level of DA and possibly 5-HT neurotransmitters is important. Thus, an excess of these transmitters could be as disruptive as their reduction or absence. Our working hypothesis is that the brain regions mediating maternal behavior in the adult, also mediate maternal behavior in the juvenile, and that postnatal neurochemical changes within these regions may underlie the maturing time course of pup-induced maternal behavior. While it is formally possible that maternal behavior in the juvenile might be supported by different neural structures or transmitters than those that support maternal behavior in the adult, we know of no data to support this alternative hypothesis. It has been hypothesized that adult rats, without benefit of the hormones of parturition, require longer exposure to pups to become maternal because their initial response to pups is a typical adult neophobic response to novel stimuli, while juveniles are generally less neophobic and affiliate readily with pups !!!REFs!!!. We hypothesize that postnatal changes within the neural circuit may add a level of inhibition to social stimuli, and that this is the fundamental difference between the juvenile and adult state. The comparison of juveniles (20–27 days old) to adults (>60 days) offers the intriguing view before and after these hypothesized developmental changes in the inhibitory components of the neural circuit occur, and to consider that these two neurotransmitters might be part of the mechanistic basis for this additional behavioral inhibition. Our goal was to examine the content of dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites in juveniles and adults within the neural circuit that mediates the expression of maternal behavior. We choose postmortem sampling of tissue punches as our approach so that we could examine multiple brain areas in juveniles and adults. An alternative, microdialysis would allow measurements in only one area at a time. First, the behavioral state of each animal was assessed. Then postmortem tissue analysis was used to determine, in each individual animal, the amount of these neurotransmitters and their metabolites in three different brain regions, the NAC, MPOA, and MCA. Two specific questions were addressed. Does the amount of these neurotransmitters and their metabolites vary with the maternal state of the rat? Is the amount of these substances in these specific regions different in adults compared with juveniles?  Hippocampal formation (HPC) EEG is characterised by a very regular sinusoidal-like pattern that reflects the synchronous activity of many synapses. This EEG pattern is known as theta or rhythmical slow activity (RSA). Theta rhythms (0.1–2mV; 3–12Hz) can be recorded with a depth electrode in awake as well as urethane-anaesthetised animals !!!REFs!!!. In addition to theta, other hippocampal EEG patterns are also regularly observed. Vandervolf et al. !!!REF!!! described three additional waveform patterns in rabbits and rats: (1) a large amplitude irregular activity (LIA) with a broadband frequency ranging from 0.5 to 25Hz; (2) a small amplitude irregular activity (SIA) and (3) fast waves occurring in the frequency range of 20–70Hz. The hippocampal theta rhythm has been extensively studied in rodents. Behavioural and pharmacological manipulations provide evidence for two distinct types of theta occurring in these species !!!REFs!!!. The first, type 1 theta, has an overall frequency range of 6–12Hz, occurs during voluntary movements (e.g. walking, running and rearing), is resistant to atropine sulphate, and sensitive to anaesthetic agents such as urethane, ethyl ether and alcohol. The second, type 2 theta, has a lower frequency range (4–9Hz), occurs during immobility, is resistant to most anaesthetics and sensitive to atropine sulphate. It is necessary to point out that the existence of two distinct types of HPC theta in other species is controversial. For example, it was found that in the cat theta occurred both during movement and immobility !!!REFs!!! and intra-peritonally administrated atropine sulphate or scopolamine completely blocked both forms of spontaneous hippocampal theta !!!REFs!!!. These results would suggest that the cat produces only one, cholinergically mediated theta rhythm which resembles the properties of type 2 theta in rats. Indeed, Goł!!!MATH!!!biewski et al. !!!REFs!!! demonstrated in freely moving cats that the HPC rhythmic field activity is mediated mainly by the cholinergic M1 receptor subtype. Recently, the same authors suggested that M2 muscarinic receptors may be also engaged in producing hippocampal EEG synchrony !!!REF!!!. There is a large body of research indicating that the occurrence of HPC theta is critically dependent on the integrity of ascending pathway originating in the brainstem reticular formation !!!REFs!!!. A number of investigations showed that reticular influences are relayed via the posterior hypothalamus (PH), specifically the posterior hypothalamic and supramammillary nuclei, and this region was considered to be an important link between the brainstem and the HPC !!!REFs!!!. The role of the PH in the generation of hippocampal theta rhythm is still poorly understood. Numerous studies in the 1970s have shown that stimulation of the medial hypothalamus results in hippocampal theta !!!REFs!!!, while stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic region results in hippocampal desynchronisation !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, Bland and Vanderwolf !!!REF!!! found that the most effective synchronising sites were localised in the dorsomedial and posterior nuclei of the hypothalamus. These data suggest that the lateral and medial hypothalamus contains the fibres of two different neuronal systems, passing from the brainstem reticular formation through the septum to the limbic cortex, responsible for desynchronising and synchronising input to the HPC !!!REFs!!!. Further investigators demonstrated in vivo that the supramammillary nucleus contained a population of neurones that discharge rhythmically at the theta frequency !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, information about the participation of PH in the generation of theta was demonstrated in studies in which the technique of reversible procaine inactivation of the posterior hypothalamic region was used !!!REFs!!!. Kirk and McNaughton !!!REF!!! suggested that in anaesthetised rats the posterior hypothalamic region determined mainly the frequency of HPC theta. Similar data were also obtained by Oddie et al. !!!REF!!! and Thinschmidt et al. !!!REF!!!. However, in contrast to anaesthetised rats the PH region in freely moving rats seems not to be involved in controlling theta frequency !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, in freely moving cats the PH region was found to contribute mainly to the amplitude of HPC theta and not to its frequency !!!REF!!!. In the present paper we extended our earlier studies concerning PH mediation of HPC theta in freely moving cats !!!REF!!!. We attempted to establish whether cholinergic receptors localised in the PH area were involved in the generation of hippocampal theta oscillations in freely behaving cats. Muscarinic (atropine sulphate, pirenzepine and gallamine) and nicotinic (hexamethonium) antagonists were administrated directly in to the PH region. Finally, the effect of the intra-posterior hypothalamic injection of a cholinergic agonist, carbachol, on hippocampal theta was also examined. The effect of injection of the cholinergic antagonists was evaluated under three different conditions: spontaneously occurring theta, theta produced by sensory stimulation and theta produced by electrical stimulation of the area of the midbrain reticular formation (MRF).  Gonadal steroids act directly on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) or, indirectly through excitatory or inhibitory interneurons !!!REF!!!. These interneurons produce various neuromediators such as noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5HT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, galanin, oxytocin, endorphin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), nitric oxide (NO), angiotensin II (AII) and the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). There are several studies about involvement of these neurotransmitters on regulation of LH-RH, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release !!!REFs!!!. There is no co-localization of mRNA for 5HT1 or 5HT2 receptors in LH-RH neurons !!!REF!!!. Serotonin indirectly acts on LH-RH neurons in the preoptic area through terminals that are juxtaposed to LH-RH neurons !!!REF!!!. In female adult rats, 5HT has bimodal action in the release of LH-RH/LH, which is inhibitory in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and stimulatory in the preoptic area, as previously suggested !!!REF!!!. The action of 5HT on the LH release depends on the presence or absence of estrogen (E2) as well as on a critical period of time. The actions which alter serotoninergic neurotransmission (administration of 5HT, precursor or inhibitor of 5HT synthesis, agonist and antagonist) are effective if they occur in an appropriate period (between 10 and 12h) on the day when the LH peak takes place. However, little is known with regard to the central site of action of 5HT, the types of participant receptors and the mediators of serotoninergic action in LH-RH neurons !!!REF!!!. The enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) converts l-arginine in equimolar amounts of l-citrulline and NO. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) is not co-localized in LH-RH neurons of the preoptic area !!!REFs!!! however, contacts between NOergic and LH-RH neurons were described in this area !!!REF!!!. In rats, NO may to stimulate the release of LH-RH by the preoptic area and medial hypothalamus !!!REFs!!!. LH-RH induces the release of both gonadotropins, however, experimental evidence has been gathered towards an alternative hypothalamic control of FSH !!!REFs!!!. There are few accounts on the action of 5HT on the secretion of FSH, although it seems to be bimodal, similarly to that described for LH !!!REF!!!. The medial preoptic area (MPOA) participates in the mechanisms for control of prolactin (PRL) release in female rats. The caudal transection of efferents or bilateral lesion of such area blocks the peak of PRL induced by estradiol !!!REFs!!!. The depletion of central 5HT induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) prevents the decreasing of activity from tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons (TIDA) and blocks the peak of PRL in ovariectomized rats treated with E2 !!!REF!!!. Lesion in raphe nuclei or treatment with antagonist ketanserin or LY53857 prevents the peak of PRL induced by E2 !!!REFs!!!. The aim of this work was to explore the participation of serotoninergic receptors 5HT1 and 5HT2 in the MPOA to control of LH, FSH, and PRL secretion as well as the possible modulation by ovarian steroids and the possible participation of NO as a mediator of the stimulatory effects of serotonin on LH secretion.  Zinc exists in the synaptic vesicles of hippocampal mossy fibers in high concentrations. Zinc concentration in the vesicles in the giant boutons of hippocampal mossy fibers is estimated to be approximately 300μM !!!REF!!!, which is higher than in the cell body. This zinc is histochemically reactive (as revealed by Timm’s sulfide-silver staining method) !!!REF!!!, contained in a subclass of glutamatergic neurons and released by a calcium- and impulse-dependent manner !!!REFs!!!. The hippocampal and amygdalar regions may possess zinc-containing glutamatergic neuron terminals in high densities !!!REF!!!. Neural circuits of the zinc-containing glutamatergic neurons are considered to be associated with the episodic memory function and are important for behavior, emotional expression, and cognitive-mnemonic operations !!!REFs!!!. Vesicular zinc may play a role in synaptic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain and serve as an endogenous neuromodulator of several important receptors including the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate, -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors !!!REFs!!!. Some evidence demonstrates that zinc is required for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses !!!REFs!!!. However, the impairment of spatial learning, memory, or sensorimotor functions was not observed in zinc transporter-3-null mice, which lack the histochemically reactive zinc in synaptic vesicles !!!REF!!!. Thus, the physiological significance of zinc as an endogenous neuromodulator is still poorly understood !!!REF!!!; it is obscure why certain subclasses of glutamatergic neurons, e.g., granule cells of the dentate gyrus, possess zinc in the presynaptic vesicles in high concentrations. Because differential actions of zinc on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems were found in the hippocampus !!!REF!!!, in the present paper, the role of zinc in release of several amino acids were studied in rat hippocampus by using in vivo microdialysis. Some amino acids tested are involved in synaptic neurotransmission. Thus, clarification of zinc action in their releases may be necessary to understand hippocampal neurotransmission via glutamate signaling.  Cocaine induces a greater enhancement of behavioral responses in female rats than in male rats. When administered acute or chronic cocaine, female rats exhibit more robust locomotor activity and behavioral sensitization than do male rats !!!REFs!!!. Sex differences also exist in the reinforcing and rewarding properties of cocaine. For example, female rats demonstrate a more rapid acquisition to cocaine self-administration, reach a higher breaking point in a progressive-ratio schedule, and have a greater response during the reinstatement phase than do male rats !!!REFs!!!. Sex differences also exist in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm; female rats developed CPP using lower doses of cocaine and with fewer conditioning days than did male rats !!!REF!!!. Although there is increasing evidence that suggests the existence of sex differences in behavioral responses to cocaine, the underlying neuronal mechanisms for these differences are not clear. The dopaminergic system is important in regulating the rewarding properties of psychostimulants !!!REFs!!!. In male rats, D1 but not D2 receptors are involved in the acquisition of cocaine conditioned place preference !!!REFs!!!. Female rats have lower D1 receptor densities in the nucleus accumbens, and greater dopamine release, reuptake and dopamine transporter density in the striatum !!!REFs!!!. We predict that the observed sex differences in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine are in part mediated through differential activation of the D1 and D2 receptors. The aim of the current study is to test this postulate.  The structures of the mesial temporal lobe are crucial for the processing of emotions. The amygdala, in particular, is important for the recognition of certain emotions from facial expressions !!!REFs!!! and from auditory stimuli !!!REF!!!, as well as for the processing of emotionally salient olfactory and gustatory stimuli !!!REFs!!!. In the studies cited above, activation of the amygdala was most frequently found in response to negative emotions, especially fear. Functional imaging studies of healthy subjects have shown an association between the processing of facial expressions of emotion and either bilateral !!!REF!!! or unilateral !!!REF!!! amygdala activation. These studies have suggested that the right amygdala is preferentially activated in response to subliminal presentation of such expressions, whereas the left amygdala is activated when the stimuli are presented for longer !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, this subcortical structure has a neuromodulatory effect on several other brain cortical regions (namely the fusiform gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, and the frontal cortex) during the sensory processing of emotionally salient stimuli !!!REFs!!!. In humans, bilateral selective damage to the amygdala impaired conditioning of autonomic responses !!!REF!!!, memory for emotional material !!!REF!!!, auditory recognition of fear and anger !!!REF!!!, recognition of facial expressions of emotion !!!REFs!!!, and social and emotional behaviour !!!REF!!!. Unilateral damage generally results in more subtle impairment. Recently, two studies found impaired ability to recognize negative emotions from facial expressions in subjects who have undergone right temporal lobectomy !!!REFs!!!. In a recent study !!!REF!!! it has been demonstrated that patients with mesial temporal epilepsy and right mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) can be impaired in recognizing emotions from facial expressions even before lobectomy. This deficit was particularly severe in patients with seizures beginning before 5 years of age. The amygdala complex may be damaged unilaterally in children and adults with temporal lobe epilepsy !!!REF!!!. Mesial temporal sclerosis is the most common neuropathological finding in MTLE. MTS is often associated with early childhood febrile convulsions and subsequently with drug-resistant seizures during adolescence. Prolonged febrile seizures in childhood have been associated with pronounced damage to the amygdala !!!REF!!!. In vivo volumetric measurements in MTLE patients have revealed that volume reduction of the amygdala in these subjects varies between 10 and 30% !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, neural loss and gliosis have been reported in a large number of histopathological studies in which amygdala tissue from MTLE patients was available for analysis, either from autopsy or from epilepsy surgery !!!REF!!!. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of unilateral mesial temporal damage on a specific neural network involved in the processing of facial expressions of emotion. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested the hypothesis that unilateral mesial temporal damage can disrupt the neural network involved in the processing of facial expressions of fear. We asked subjects to perform a gender discrimination task. During the task they were presented both with faces expressing fear and with faces that had neutral expressions. We also examined the effect of early versus late damage, comparing data from subjects with MTS and early-onset seizures with those of epilepsy patients with mesial temporal lesions other than MTS. The results demonstrated that right MTLE patients are impaired in recognizing facial expressions of fear, and that reduced performance in recognition tasks is associated with lack of activation of the neural network associated with the processing of facial expressions of fear.  Chemosignals from conspecifics regulate many aspects of the reproductive physiology and behavior of mice, both stimulating and inhibiting their reproductive activities (reviewed in !!!REFs!!!). For instance, gonadotropin release and the timing of puberty in juvenile females is affected by chemosignals in the urine of adult male and female adult conspecifics !!!REFs!!!, and chemosignals from adult females and males stimulate the release of gonadotropins and testosterone in adult females and males, respectively !!!REFs!!!. While these responses are quite predictable, they are not fixed; rather, the response a mouse manifests to a specific conspecific chemosignal can be modulated by other factors in its environment, including the season in which the chemosignal is encountered !!!REF!!! and the simultaneous presence of other chemosignals !!!REFs!!!. Although the social structure of mice varies between feral and commensal populations !!!REFs!!!, both male and female mice scent mark frequently in the areas they inhabit !!!REF!!!. It is unlikely that this scent marking produces an olfactory environment that consists of cues that are either exclusively reproductively-inhibiting or reproductively-stimulating; rather, it is likely that mice are exposed to both classes of chemosignal, albeit in varying concentrations with one another !!!REF!!!. Two examples, one involving juvenile females and the other involving adult males, illustrate the types of responses mice may manifest to these complex mixtures of reproductively-relevant chemosignals. Juvenile female mice typically show an accelerated onset of puberty when exposed to urine from adult males or pregnant females, but show delayed puberty when exposed to urine from females maintained in groups !!!REFs!!!. When they are exposed to urine from either pregnant females or males mixed in equal proportion with urine from grouped females, though, the puberty-accelerating effects of the male and pregnant female urine are blocked and the onset of puberty is substantially delayed relative to control females !!!REFs!!!. By way of comparison, adult male mice show a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) release when they are exposed to female urine but not in response to male urine !!!REFs!!!; however, when males are exposed to female urine mixed in equal proportion with male urine, the male urine blocks the LH surge that is normally induced by the female urine !!!REF!!!. This indicates that the endocrine responses of mice to reproductively-inhibiting chemosignals may, at least under some circumstances, take precedence over their responses to reproductively-stimulating chemosignals when the two are experienced simultaneously. The goal of the present experiment was to describe the neural correlates of the mechanism through which adult male mice integrate and respond to mixtures of reproductively-relevant chemosignals. The vomeronasal organs and accessory olfactory system mediate the endocrine responses of male mice to female chemosignals !!!REFs!!!. Chemoreceptor neurons within the vomeronasal organs synapse with mitral cells within the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which then project to the medial amygdala !!!REFs!!!. Projections from the medial amygdala extend to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), preoptic area (POA), and nuclei throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we assessed whether or not urine from male mice affected the responses of neurons within the accessory olfactory system of adult male mice to female urine. Given that female-induced LH surges in male mice are correlated with the induction of Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) within this system !!!REF!!!, we hypothesized that if male urine inhibits the responses of other adult males to female urine by decreasing their chemosensory responses to female urine, then adult males exposed a mixture of male and female urine would have fewer Fos-ir cells within their AOS than males exposed to female urine alone.  The receptor for one of the main inhibitory neuromediators, glycine receptor (GlyR), is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, which also consists of nicotinic, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors !!!REF!!!. The glycine receptor is abundant in brain stem and spinal cord !!!REF!!!, but sparse in higher brain areas, including hippocampus, where main inhibitory influences are mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid. Glycine-activated responses were found in pyramidal hippocampal neurons of rat a long time ago !!!REFs!!!. In situ hybridisation studies indicate that mRNA encoding α2, α3 and αβ-subunits is present in hippocampus !!!REF!!!, suggesting that the content of glycine receptors, which are expressed in hippocampus is heterogeneous. Moreover, the distribution of different subtype-composed glycine receptors binds to their functional purpose, as was reported that α homomeric receptors, the immature GlyR subtype is extrasynaptic, whereas αβ heteromeric GlyRs, the mature form of the receptor that is synaptically located !!!REFs!!!. Recently, the presence of glycine-activated strychnine sensitive receptors in both pyramidal neurons and interneurons has been convincingly confirmed by Chattipakorn and McMahon !!!REF!!! by using immunohictochemical methods in rat hippocampal slices. It was found that the content of glycine receptors, which are distributed throughout the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus, is heterogeneous. According to Chattipakorn and McMahon !!!REF!!!, both α1 homomeric and α1/β heteromeric receptors are expressed in month old Wistar rats. Previous findings supported the idea that heteromeric glycine receptors are expressed in hippocampal neurons within first 2 weeks after birth !!!REF!!!. In earlier studies we have shown that the constituents of Ginkgo biloba extract (ginkgolides A, B, C and J) block glycine-activated receptors in the neurons of hippocampus with different extent of activity !!!REF!!!. The action of each ginkgolide has strong features of use-dependence. In combination with voltage-dependence, this is a strong evidence for the open-channel blocking action !!!REF!!!. In this study we address the question, whether this action of ginkgolides reveal any signs of subunit specificity.  Blood loss initiates a complex array of neural and hormonal responses that serve to defend arterial blood pressure. During mild-to-moderate blood losses of less than 25–35% of blood volume, blood pressure is maintained near normal levels by peripheral vasoconstriction (non-hypotensive hemorrhage). This phase of the response to blood loss is typified by high sympathetic nerve activity !!!REF!!!, and increased plasma renin and vasopressin levels !!!REFs!!!. While it is known that the increase in plasma renin levels that accompanies non-hypotensive hemorrhage is mediated by sympathetic activation !!!REFs!!!, the central nervous system pathways that orchestrate this response are not fully understood. Cardiovascular sensory information from arterial baroreceptors and atrial volume receptors is conveyed to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and is relayed to the ventrolateral medulla. Ascending pathways that convey cardiovascular sensory information to supramedullary structures originate from both the NTS and ventrolateral medulla !!!REF!!!. Lesions of the NTS significantly blunt the renin response to moderate blood loss !!!REF!!!, but the role of supramedullary structures in hemorrhage-induced renin release is unclear !!!REF!!!. Previous investigations demonstrate that the renin response to blood loss is not mediated by either the pontine lateral parabrachial nucleus !!!REF!!! or the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) !!!REF!!!. These regions are viewed as major supramedullary autonomic integrative centers, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus also serves as the primary supramedullary relay for autonomic sensory information to the forebrain !!!REF!!!. Similarly, lesions of the ventral noradrenergic bundle, which carries ventrolateral medulla A1 and NTS A2 noradrenergic projections directly to the paraventricular nucleus and other hypothalamic regions !!!REFs!!! also fail to alter the renin response to small volume hemorrhage !!!REF!!!. In contrast, the renin response to a small volume (5ml/kg) hemorrhage is significantly attenuated by lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNAB) in anesthetized rats !!!REF!!!. The dorsal noradrenergic bundle originates from the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus and has widespread forebrain projections. Portions of the A1 ascending projections also travel in association with the dorsal noradrenergic bundle !!!REF!!!. The observation that dorsal noradrenergic bundle lesions attenuate the renin response to non-hypotensive hemorrhage !!!REF!!! constitutes the primary evidence that supramedullary structures play an essential role in mediating the renin response to blood loss !!!REF!!!. However, these experiments were performed in anesthetized animals, and anesthesia is known to alter central nervous system control of renal sympathetic nerve activity !!!REF!!!, to elevate basal plasma renin levels !!!REFs!!!, and to augment the renin response to blood loss !!!REF!!!. Accordingly, the present study was designed to determine if signals carried by the dorsal noradrenergic bundle play an essential role in the renin response to blood loss even in the absence of anesthesia. The majority of the vasopressin released into the bloodstream during hemorrhage originates from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) !!!REF!!!. Immunocytochemical localization of Fos protein, a marker for neuronal activation, shows that non-hypotensive hemorrhage induces robust Fos expression in the vasopressin neurons of the SON !!!REFs!!!. Lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle, but not the ventral noradrenergic bundle, significantly blunt the magnitude of the plasma vasopressin response to small volume (5–8ml/kg) blood loss in both anesthetized !!!REF!!! and unanesthetized !!!REF!!! animals. This suggests that activation of SON vasopressin neurons by non-hypotensive hemorrhage may be dependent on signals conveyed by the dorsal noradrenergic bundle. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus also exhibits robust Fos expression in response to non-hypotensive hemorrhage. This increased Fos immunoreactivity is most prominent within the parvicellular component of the nucleus !!!REFs!!!. A subset of the noradrenergic innervation of the parvicellular PVN is conveyed by the dorsal noradrenergic bundle !!!REF!!!, but the contribution of these dorsal noradrenergic bundle projections to hemorrhage-induced PVN activation has not previously been evaluated. The central nucleus of the amygdala shows robust Fos immunoreactivity in animals exposed to a rapid blood loss sufficient to cause significant hypotension !!!REF!!!, and also is known to play a major role in mediating renin responses to psychological stress !!!REF!!!. To the best of our knowledge, however, neither the central nucleus of the amygdala, nor any other forebrain region except for the hypothalamic PVN and SON, has been reported to reliably demonstrate increased Fos immunoreactivity after a small volume, non-hypotensive hemorrhage. The goal of this study was to determine if the dorsal noradrenergic bundle plays an essential role in mediating increased plasma renin levels and activation of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, as indicated by increased Fos expression, in response to a small volume (non-hypotensive) blood loss, in unanesthetized animals. To accomplish this goal, animals were prepared with bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine or sham lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle, and were subsequently subjected to controlled sequential blood losses of 5 and 10ml/kg, in the absence of anesthesia.  Salt appetite is a biological drive normally triggered by a negative sodium (Na+) balance. This behavior is manifest by a switch from avoidance of concentrated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution to avid ingestion. Although salt appetite can occur naturally, there are numerous methods for its induction, like bilateral adrenalectomy !!!REF!!! and injections of furosemide !!!REF!!!, captopril !!!REF!!!, propranolol !!!REF!!!, deoxycorticosterone acetate !!!REF!!!, polyethylene glycol !!!REF!!!, and intracerebroventricular renin !!!REF!!! and angiotensin II !!!REF!!!. The primary advantage of most procedures is the rapid production of the behavior; the disadvantage is that they are invasive. The most common experimental procedure for induction of Na+ appetite is subcutaneous injections of the loop diuretic furosemide that produces a rapid loss of urinary sodium. Most studies use ≥10mg/kg furosemide, typically in a divided dose separated by 2h. In addition to a stimulatory effect on salt intake, however, this dose level also suppresses food intake and weight gain !!!REFs!!!. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one experimental paradigm for induction of salt appetite that is both non-invasive and without anorectic activity, dietary sodium restriction. Although a more natural condition for its occurrence, the sodium appetite produced by dietary manipulation alone requires much longer to develop, typically 7–10 days !!!REFs!!!. The objective of the present study was to investigate a novel procedure for induction of a Na+ appetite. Amiloride is an inhibitor of epithelial sodium channels and is known to increase Na+ excretion by blocking reabsorption in the luminal membrane of principle cells in the late distal tubule and collecting duct !!!REFs!!!. Thus, we tested the effects of oral consumption of amiloride on intake of concentrated NaCl solution using a standard salt appetite procedure. The results show that amiloride increased urinary Na+ loss and produced a robust salt appetite.  The human face presents a clear sexual dimorphism !!!REFs!!!. Face gender recognition is an extremely efficient and fast cognitive process !!!REF!!!. Even when images are cropped to remove all cultural cues to gender such as hairstyle and make-up, gender classification is correct in almost 100% of the cases in adult subjects !!!REF!!!, whereas 7-years-old children already reach 80% accuracy in the same task !!!REF!!!. These data clearly indicate that biological cues in facial anatomy are sufficient for a very efficient gender recognition and this ability is acquired early during childhood. Male and female faces differ both for shape and texture and both shape and texture cues are used for face gender recognition. In frontal views, texture is more salient than shape for gender classification whereas the salience of shape becomes greater in lateral view !!!REFs!!!. Isolated facial parts can be used for face gender classification and the eye region has the highest load in judging gender, followed by the face outline !!!REFs!!!. Some global aspects of face configuration, however, are also important for face gender classification !!!REFs!!!. The present study was undertaken to answer these two basic questions: Is gender recognition equally efficient for male and female faces? Is there an interaction between gender of the observer and gender of the target face? Since ceiling effects are prominent in face gender recognition, to address these questions it is necessary to increase the difficulty of the gender classification task. Masking by spatial filtration is a widely-used technique in psychophysics. We have used two different and complementary spatial filtration techniques to mask pictures of male and female faces and study the effect of spatial filtration on gender recognition. In one case, a pixelation filter was used. This type of filtration greatly disturbs shape information but spares information concerning average colour distribution in the image. The second filter we have used is a Gaussian noise filter: it destroys information concerning average colour composition of the image leaving detection of high-contrast edges relatively spared. We found that both modalities of spatial filtration affect recognition of female faces more than recognition of male faces. In addition, male subject were more efficient in recognising male faces whereas female subjects were more efficient in recognising female faces regardless of the spatial filtration method used.  During suckling, oxytocin (OT) is released intermittently from the neurohypophysial terminals !!!REFs!!!. Each OT release, shown by increase of intramammary pressure, is preceded by a synchronized short high frequency burst of action potentials in most oxytocin cells of paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) !!!REF!!!. In spite of many studies on the neural mechanisms controlling such periodic and synchronized activation of OT cells during milk-ejection reflex, exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) was originally found to be a ligand of an orphan receptor (hGR3) !!!REF!!!. PrRP and its receptor have been found in many brain areas !!!REFs!!!, suggesting many function in addition to its original prolactin-releasing activity !!!REF!!!. The hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus (DMH) is suggested to be a final relay site for the afferent of milk-ejection reflex (MER) !!!REF!!!. Existence of PrRP-immunoreactive cells !!!REF!!! and cells expressing PrRP-mRNA !!!REF!!! in the DMH was reported. Furthermore, synaptic contact of PrRP-IR terminals with OT cells in the SON was reported !!!REF!!!. It was also shown that intracerebroventricular injection of PrRP stimulated OT release in rats !!!REF!!!. Present experiments were therefore, undertaken to examine whether PrRP affected the electrical activity of OT cells in the SON during suckling.  The brain structures including the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus and periventricular nucleus are generically called the anteroventral third ventricular region (AV3V) !!!REF!!!. The AV3V lacks an intact blood–brain barrier, and possesses neural circuits responsible for detecting osmotic changes in the circulating blood and transmitting this information to the various regions involved in the homeostatic responses !!!REFs!!!. In addition, the AV3V has different receptors for neurohumoral factors and the ability to enhance local synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E2 in response to stimuli such as cytokines !!!REFs!!!. The neural excitation generated in the AV3V by plasma hypertonicity or PGE2 is conveyed to the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and other loci, and causes a variety of phenomena, such as promoted secretion of AVP or CRH and induction of cardiovascular, drinking or febrile responses !!!REFs!!!. However, the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators operating in the AV3V for these phenomena have yet to be fully understood. The excitatory amino acid glutamate has the potential to be one of the crucial neurotransmitters functioning in the AV3V in the hyperosmotic state !!!REF!!!. The organum vasculosum lamina terminalis and median preoptic nucleus include presynaptic boutons containing high levels of glutamate !!!REF!!!. Both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) exist in the AV3V !!!REFs!!!. When applied to the AV3V, an ionotropic receptor agonist, -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), stimulates AVP secretion remarkably, and its receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocks not only this effect but also the AVP release in response to systemic administration of hypertonic saline !!!REF!!!. These observations lead to the proposal that glutamate may mediate hyperosmolality-evoked AVP secretion via NMDA receptors in the AV3V. However, despite the findings that mGluRs are present on the cell bodies and dendrites of AV3V neurons !!!REFs!!!, and that some of their nerve endings may innervate AVP neurons in the supraoptic nucleus !!!REF!!!, the role of AV3V mGluRs in controlling AVP secretion has not been elucidated to date. The function of cerebral mGluRs in AVP release has been explored through in vitro investigations employing hypothalamic tissue with !!!REF!!! or without the neurohypophysis !!!REFs!!!. However, these studies produced the conflicting results that mGluR agonists added to the external media induced an increase !!!REF!!! or a decrease !!!REFs!!! in AVP secretion, possibly due to the structural difference between the utilized tissues. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, no in vivo studies attempting to elucidate the role of brain mGluRs have been published. As mentioned above, PGE2 acts on its receptors in the AV3V !!!REF!!! to excite efferent neural pathways related to various functions !!!REFs!!!. In the hippocampus, a representative area indicating the physiological importance of glutamate receptors, it has been demonstrated that mGluRs interact with PGE2 to provoke long-term potentiation and rises in cytosolic free Ca2+, as do NMDA receptors !!!REFs!!!. Although we recently reported that NMDA receptors in the AV3V may be implicated in the AVP secretion prompted by PGE2 production in this area !!!REF!!!, it is not certain whether mGluRs are also involved with this phenomenon. Addressing this issue seems to be significant for obtaining further information regarding the functional relationship between PGE2 and glutamate in the AV3V. Furthermore, such an attempt seems significant for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the AV3V mechanism regulating AVP secretion, since there is evidence that suggests that AV3V PGE2 participates in osmotically-induced hormone release !!!REFs!!!. The aims of this study were to reveal how stimulation of the mGluRs in the AV3V under basal conditions may alter AVP secretion and cardiovascular function, and to evaluate their roles in regulating these events in states associated with rises in plasma osmolality or AV3V PGE2. In conscious and unrestrained rats, we first examined the effects of AV3V infusion of a mGluR agonist, t-ACPD !!!REFs!!!, on plasma AVP, osmolality, electrolytes, heart rate and arterial pressure, and then tested the influence of AV3V application of its antagonist, MCPG !!!REFs!!!, on the responses of these variables to AV3V infusion of t-ACPD or PGE2 or to i.v. infusion of hypertonic NaCl. Since it was suspected that the drugs applied to the AV3V would diffuse into the ventricular system to produce their effects, t-ACPD was also administered into the cerebral ventricle to compare its potency. Moreover, the AV3V actions of a cAMP agonist, 8-bromo (Br)-cAMP, were checked, since it is possible that the responses of the variables to the t-ACPD infusion might be mediated, at least in part, by a change in cAMP production !!!REFs!!!.  The prolactin (PRL) secretion pattern during the estrous cycle of the rat is marked by a preovulatory surge in the afternoon of proestrus !!!REF!!!. It is generally accepted that the rising plasma levels of estradiol that peak around midday of proestrus signal the hypothalamus–pituitary axis to release the PRL surge since estradiol immunoneutralization in the morning of diestrus prevents the occurrence of this surge !!!REF!!!. As the surge of progesterone in the afternoon of proestrus coincides with the preovulatory PRL surge !!!REF!!! and the administration of this hormone to estradiol-primed ovariectomized rats anticipates and amplifies the estradiol-induced PRL surge !!!REFs!!!, progesterone seems to play a stimulatory role in the regulation of the preovulatory PRL surge as well. PRL secretion is known to be tonically inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine and stimulated by a number of PRL-releasing factors (PRFs) (for references see !!!REF!!!). The proestrus surge of PRL is probably generated by a synchronous action of these neurotransmitters/neuromodulators which, in turn, are modulated by the ovarian steroids. Among neurotransmitters, norepinephrine (NE) seems to stimulate PRL secretion. Increased NE concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid !!!REF!!! as well as intracerebroventricular !!!REF!!! and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) microinjections of NE !!!REF!!! stimulate PRL secretion in male rats. Inhibition of NE synthesis prevents the pulsatile secretion of PRL in ovariectomized rats and this effect can be reversed by the administration of clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist !!!REF!!!. Also, in ovariectomized estradiol-primed rats, ventral noradrenergic tract stimulation increases PRL secretion !!!REF!!! whereas its lesion blocks the steroid-induced PRL surge !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the estradiol-induced PRL surge in ovariectomized rats is accompanied by a rise in MBH NE release !!!REF!!! and is prevented by either NE synthesis inhibition !!!REF!!! or alpha-adrenergic antagonism !!!REF!!!. Similar data have also been reported concerning the PRL surge of proestrus, since this surge coincides with an increase in both NE release in MBH !!!REF!!! and NE turnover in the median eminence !!!REF!!! and is suppressed by dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition, a key enzyme for NE synthesis !!!REF!!!. The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) innervates, among others, areas related to the neuroendocrine control of PRL secretion, such as preoptic area (POA), medial septal area (MSA), and MBH (for references see !!!REF!!!). Previous data from our laboratory have shown that LC is a stimulatory nucleus for the PRL surge of proestrus since LC lesion completely prevents its occurrence !!!REF!!!. However, it is not known whether LC participates in the control of PRL secretion in other conditions rather than the proestrus surge. Thus, the aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate if LC lesion would also block the PRL surges induced by ovarian-steroids in ovariectomized rats and (2) to determine if LC lesion would alter PRL secretion throughout the estrous cycle of females and that of male rats.  Maternal diet and nutrient intake influence “programming” !!!REF!!!, a process whereby a stimulus administered during a critical period of early life has permanent effects on the structure, physiology and metabolism, that endures in adulthood. The importance of maternal nutrition in programming has been evidenced !!!REF!!!. Much is also reported about the importance of malnutrition in neonatal programming !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, less is known about the effect of additional nutrients intake. For example, the administration of amino acids is usually considered non-toxic, yet early postnatal administration of monosodium-l-glutamate produces in adult rats a syndrome characterized by stunted growth, neuroendocrine disturbances, and increase in fat carcass without hyperphagia, and a deficit in hippocampal long-term potentiation !!!REF!!!, and an immature blood–brain barrier is a favorable condition for these consequences !!!REF!!!. Therefore, studies on the possible late effects induced by early administration of amino acids are of interest. Currently, taurine is added to cow’s milk and to soy protein-based milk used for the preparation of infant formula !!!REF!!! and to parenteral nutrition solutions for prematures !!!REF!!!. This sulphur compound is a semi-essential amino acid for adults, but it is essential for foetuses and newborns !!!REFs!!!. In prenatal and neonatal periods, a taurine-free diet determines alterations in retina, in nervous system and pancreas development !!!REFs!!!. However, information as to whether taurine supplementation modifies programming in neonates which are fed with normal diet is still needed. This is an important point, because taurine supplementation and taurine-containing health drinks are marketed worldwide for the treatment of various conditions and for the “general well being” !!!REF!!!. Taurine is a calcium modulator and an agonist of glycinergic receptors !!!REFs!!!, which assume adult configuration postnatally !!!REF!!!. Calcium exerts a crucial role in the long lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission !!!REFs!!! and in hippocampus slices the in vitro application of taurine generates a long lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic potentials that depends on calcium ions !!!REF!!!. The first week of life is a period of intense synaptogenesis in rodent hippocampus !!!REF!!!. Neonatal stressors including maternal separation !!!REF!!! modify hippocampus plasticity, which is believed to be essential for some forms of memories, such as spatial learning !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, neonatal handling may affect behavioural adaptation to the environment !!!REFs!!! to an extent which depends on the duration and the timing of maternal separation !!!REF!!!. This is in line with the known influence of parental care on cognitive development in non-human primates and humans !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, it has been reported that childhood abuse and neglecting parental behaviour appear to increase vulnerability to the development of affective and anxiety disorders !!!REFs!!!. In this study, we examined whether neonatal taurine administration may exert some influences on the behavioural alterations and hippocampal modifications induced by neonatal stressors in adulthood. Stressors consisted of short-lasting and repeated maternal deprivation plus mild painful stress (subcutaneous sham injection) !!!REFs!!!. Stressors and drug treatments were always administered once daily from postnatal day 1–21.  The arachidonic acid (AA) cascade (!!!REF!!! ) involves the release and metabolism of AA from cell membrane phospholipids and the production of bioactive eicosanoids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Lithium, a widely used mood-stabilizing agent, has been reported to reduce brain AA turnover by 80% (7), downregulate the total phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, as well as mRNA and protein levels of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2, type IV), but not the protein level of Ca2+-independent iPLA2 !!!REFs!!!. The effect of Li+ on cPLA2 was accompanied by a downregulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein and activity levels !!!REF!!!. Brain Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity comprises two major classes of PLA2 enzymes: cPLA2 and secretory PLA2 (sPLA2). Both are thought to be involved in signaling, whereas, iPLA2 is thought to contribute to phospholipid remodeling !!!REF!!!. Cross-talk mechanisms between cPLA2 and sPLA2 have been reported in mesangial cells !!!REF!!! and in neuronal cells in culture, where sPLA2 activates a signaling cascade that includes activation of cPLA2, AA release, and COX-2 induction !!!REF!!!. Based on evidence of cross-talk between cPLA2 and sPLA2 enzymes, we thought it of interest to examine whether lithium selectively targets cPLA2 only or also affects sPLA2. Furthermore, since, valproate and carbamazepine, and other commonly used mood-stabilizers, downregulate COX-mediated AA metabolism without affecting protein levels of the other major AA metabolizing enzymes, such as 5-lipooxygenase (5-LO) and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase !!!REFs!!!, we wanted to see if lithium’s effect is also specific to the COX pathway. Additionally, we wanted to know if the decrease in brain PGE2 concentration by lithium is due only to downregulation of COX-2 !!!REF!!! or also involves a downregulation of PGE synthase, which also is necessary for PGE2 formation !!!REF!!!. A better understanding of the mechanism by which mood-stabilizers modulate AA metabolism can help to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat bipolar disorder.  Heroin is one of the major worldwide drugs of abuse especially among people of childbearing age. The neuroteratogenicity of heroin and other opiates has been widely reported in both humans and laboratory animals !!!REFs!!!. Prenatal heroin exposure produces alterations in the septohippocampal innervation and in the behaviors associated with this structure !!!REF!!!, such as spatial memory !!!REF!!!, that can be corrected with neural grafting !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, exposure increases the total amount of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the septohippocampal innervation !!!REF!!!, and of the M1 subtype specifically !!!REF!!!, and an increase in mAChR mediated IP formation !!!REFs!!!. Basal membranal PKC levels are higher, yet there is little or no response to receptor stimulation !!!REF!!!, an effect also seen with PKCγ specifically !!!REF!!!. Additional postsynaptic alterations include an increase in the Gi and Gq subtypes of G-proteins !!!REF!!! and an increase in adenylate cyclase !!!REF!!!. On the presynaptic cell an increase in the amount of choline transporters is seen !!!REF!!!. Together, these results provide a view of global hyperactivity, both in the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells, although the postsynaptic PKC response is greatly diminished !!!REF!!!. Overwhelming evidence is available on opioid regulation of the cholinergic innervations, and although results vary depending on the experimental conditions and parameters !!!REF!!!, certain patterns can emerge. It appears that activating the μ-receptors inhibits cholinergic activity and function assessed by cholinergic-related learning tasks. Thus, morphine, a μ-preferring agonist, inhibited ACh release in several CNS regions !!!REF!!! including the hippocampus !!!REF!!!. In the striatum, the inhibition occurred via μ- and δ-receptors but not via κ-receptors !!!REFs!!!. Functional (behavioral) studies were consistent in that antagonists, and not agonists, of μ- and κ-opioid receptors improve performance in learning tasks !!!REFs!!!. The PKC family of serine/threonine kinases has been implicated in various steps of memory formation !!!REFs!!! as well as in LTP !!!REF!!!. Upon stimulation by extracellular signals such as binding of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to their physiological agonists, a cascade of intracellular signaling occurs including an increase in the classical PKC co-factors, DAG and Ca2+, which leads to a dynamic and reversible redistribution between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of PKC !!!REF!!!, a phenomenon also observed during LTP !!!REF!!!. Studies have shown the PKC undergoes three ordered phosphorylation !!!REF!!! during processing that are necessary for enzymatic activation and membranal attachment. The enzyme’s involvement in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks has been widely investigated and have shown that PKC distribution is altered following hippocampus-dependent learning !!!REF!!!, including an increase in membrane-bound PKC !!!REF!!! and a decrease in cytosolic PKC !!!REF!!!, while PKC inhibitors, which prevent the enzyme’s phosphorylations, and therefore its redistribution, delay the acquisition of a spatial learning task !!!REF!!!. The amount of membrane-bound !!!REF!!! and cytosolic !!!REF!!! PKC correlates with the ability to learn a spatial memory task. The hippocampus dependent contextual fear conditioning !!!REF!!! has also been shown to be dependent upon PKC !!!REF!!!. Different PKC isozymes have been studied for their specific role in learning and memory, especially the PKCγ and PKCβ isoforms. Levels of each of these isozymes is correlated with learning performance !!!REFs!!! while PKCγ knockout mice are impaired in spatial memory !!!REF!!! and PKCβII knockouts are impaired in fear conditioning !!!REF!!!. Studies suggest a functional !!!REF!!!, as well as an anatomical !!!REF!!!, co-localization between mAChR and PKCγ, both of which play an important role in hippocampal learning and memory. Therefore, in the current study we used carbachol as a stimulator of the M1 receptor which is the predominant muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in the hippocampus !!!REF!!!. It is bound to Gq !!!REF!!! and is implicated in LTP and memory !!!REFs!!! and in the heroin neuroteratogenicity observed !!!REFs!!!. The current study was aimed to establish the parameters for receptor stimulated activation and translocation of the behaviorally relevant PKC isoforms, and based on this knowledge to ascertain the effect of prenatal heroin exposure on these processes. This understanding will provide the groundwork for further studies on the possible mechanistic role of these processes in heroin neuroteratogenicity.  Acute and chronic stressful stimuli activate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are the main neuropeptide-hormones of the parvocellular neurones of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) that regulate the HPA axis !!!REFs!!!. These hypophysiotropic hormones stimulate adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion via different second messenger systems, which interact and potentiate each other’s action to elicit a full release of ACTH. The relative contributions of CRH and AVP to ACTH release during stress seem to be stressor-specific !!!REF!!!, but there is an emerging view that AVP is the principal regulated variable that imparts situation-specific drive on the HPA axis, whereas CRH serves mainly to impose stimulatory tone !!!REFs!!!. Inhibitory feedback is provided by adrenal glucocorticoids, which reduce the secretory activity of the endocrinomotor neurons of the hypothalamus and the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) producing cells of the anterior pituitary !!!REF!!!. In chronic stress there is a facilitatory mechanism that helps maintaining the chronic hyperactivity of the HPA axis in the face of inhibitory feedback maintained by the repeated and/or long-lasting elevations of corticosteroid hormones !!!REFs!!!. It has been proposed that during chronic stressful stimulation and/or adrenalectomy there is a shift in favour of a preferential activation of AVP rather than CRH, and the relative resistance to feedback inhibition of ACTH release stimulated by AVP may explain how chronic stressful stimulation maintains high adrenocortical hormone levels !!!REFs!!!. This hypothesis is well supported by circumstantial evidence, such as preferential increase of AVP in the median eminence in adjuvant-induced arthritis !!!REF!!!, repeated insulin treatment and immobilization !!!REFs!!!, increased AVP binding and V1b receptor mRNA levels in the anterior pituitary !!!REF!!! and increased AVP mRNA and hnRNA in the PVN of the chronically stressed rats !!!REFs!!!. However, the direct role of AVP in maintaining chronic stress responsiveness has not yet been tested in critical experiments, such as immunoneutralization with AVP antibody, V1b receptor antagonist, V1b receptor null mutants or AVP deficient mutant rats. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the presence and upregulation of AVP is necessary for maintaining high levels of adrenocortical activity during chronic stress using the vasopressin deficient mutant Brattleboro rat !!!REF!!!. We used repeated restraint as a combined psychological-physical stress stimulus. In case AVP signalling is instrumental for the maintenance of adrenocortical responsiveness during chronic stress then the AVP deficient animals are expected to show markedly impaired adrenocortical responses in a chronic stress situation.  Motor skill learning is a complex behavioral process with many interrelated components. It is often assessed by measuring the accuracy or efficiency of movement that is targeted to a specific outcome !!!REFs!!!. When successive attempts to perform the movement result in the desired outcome, a motor skill has been acquired !!!REF!!!. In compound and sequential movements, there are too many muscle actions whose temporal relationships are too rapid and their magnitudes too precise to plan consciously. Movement is thus largely automatic, controlled by a background subconscious mental subroutine. When learning new compound movements, one might be aware of a few muscles and joints, nonetheless, the unlearned novel movement is ‘uncoordinated’: muscles are not yet linked together in the correct combination, timing, or magnitude of activation. Thus, implicit motor learning can be defined as a class of motor learning that does not require conscious participation, instead, relates to a background subconscious mental subroutine, establishing the correct combination, timing, or magnitude of activation of the muscle !!!REF!!!. In humans, neuronal mechanisms of motor learning have been studied using positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while a subject performs sequence learning !!!REFs!!!, visual tracking !!!REF!!!, or maze tracing tasks !!!REF!!!. As the effects of motor skill learning are not easily isolated from those of the physical behaviors required to perform the task, it is often difficult to assign task-related activation found in functional neuroimaging to either implicit motor learning or related cognitive processes. The purpose of the present study is to implement a motor task in order to isolate and describe the neural correlates of implicit motor learning. First, in order to assess implicit motor learning, we chose a task that requires complex muscle coordination but no explicit cognitive contribution. The selected unimanual movement involves rotating two balls in the palm of either hand !!!REF!!!. This complex, multipoint hand movement is considered a motor skill, as it requires smooth coordination of the fingers and palm, along with appropriate timing. The two-ball rotation task includes a sequential pattern of activation of the finger involved in correctly performing the task, whose temporal relationships are too rapid and their magnitudes too precise to plan consciously. Hence acquiring the two-ball rotation skill is, by definition mentioned above, implicit motor learning. This motor skill can be easily acquired and continuously improved during the timecourse of a PET experiment (approximately 2h), but learning does not require any complex cognitive procedures such as the generation or memorization of a sequence, or the coordination of visual inputs with motor outputs. Our working hypothesis is that the brain regions participating in implicit motor learning show preferential activity during earlier learning phases, which then decreases as the movement is repeated and becomes more efficient. Second, we attempted to address the hand effect on the learning process by examining both hands, starting with the training of one hand followed by the opposite hand. Our hypothesis was that the learning related areas irrespective of the trained hands are candidates for transferring the learning effect, if any. We measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with PET and !!!MATH!!! water as an index of neuronal activity !!!REF!!! consecutively during learning of the motor skill, which was novel to all subjects. To exclude the speed-accuracy trade-off !!!REF!!!, and to eliminate a frequency-dependent change in neuronal activity !!!REFs!!!, the task was performed at a slow (0.5Hz), constant frequency with auditory pacing during PET scanning. Simultaneously, discharges on an electromyogram (EMG) were monitored to evaluate the degree of learning, assuming that the EMG indicates energy expenditure, and hence efficiency of the movement. After each PET scan with cued movements (paced rotation task sessions), subjects were asked to rotate the balls as quickly as they could for 1min, which was repeated twice (quick rotation task sessions). The number of rotations per minute (rpm) during the quick rotation task session was used to measure the quickness of the movements. Total length of the training period was strictly controlled. A correlational change between quickness and smoothness, as well as between smoothness and rCBF, was explored. Finally, the regions with learning related activation irrespective of the trained hands were depicted, correlating the activity with the learning transfer.  The anteroventral region of the third ventricle (AV3V) is important in the regulation of cardiovascular and fluid balance. This brain region includes the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), preoptic periventricular nucleus, median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and the interconnections between these regions and the subfornical organ (SFO). Lesions of the AV3V regions alter fluid balance, producing adipsia and hypernatremia !!!REF!!!. They also block the vasopressin and oxytocin secretion response to osmotic stimulation !!!REFs!!!. The alterations are similar to those seen in patients with the syndrome of essential or neurogenic hypernatremia, which follows brain damage, particularly of the rostral forebrain !!!REF!!!. There is general consensus that osmoreceptors rather than sodium receptors present in these regions are able to detect alterations in plasma osmolality and that these afferent signals are relayed to magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and PVN !!!REFs!!!. Neural input from the AV3V region alters neuronal firing and consequently VP and OT secretion !!!REFs!!!. The input may also alter mRNA expression and peptide synthesis/processing. In fact, rats submitted to osmotic stimuli show an increase in the content and size of VP and OT mRNA as a first indicator of increased peptide synthesis !!!REFs!!!. The increase in mRNA size is due to an increase in the poly(A) tail of VP and OT mRNA, which should affect translation and/or intracellular compartmentalization !!!REFs!!!. In earlier studies, we reported that AV3V lesions abolished the neurosecretory but not the molecular endocrine responses to chronic salt consumption. In our original studies, AV3V lesions produced no change in basal mRNA levels in SON or PVN !!!REF!!!. In addition, in contrast to expectations, the lesioned animals showed an increase in VP and OT mRNA in response to dehydration. This suggested dissociation between the molecular and the neurosecretory events !!!REF!!!. We speculated that some signal is still reaching the hypothalamic neurons and could be responsible for an increased message translation. As hormone concentration in microdissected brain areas represents the net effect of changes in hormone synthesis and release we investigated the consequence of the AV3V lesions on VP and OT content in the SON and PVN under control/water replete conditions and after 48h of dehydration.  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are regulated by mechanisms that induce the attenuation of signaling when the receptor is continuously occupied by the agonist !!!REFs!!!. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are enzymes that phosphorylate serine/threonine residues in the carboxy-terminal of many different types of agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors !!!REFs!!!. The phosphorylation of receptors by these enzymes promotes the binding of arrestin to activated receptors, which leads to receptor desensitization through their uncoupling from G proteins !!!REFs!!!. At least six enzymes, divided in three families by their sequence homology, were cloned from mammals and extensively characterized !!!REFs!!!. More recently, a novel member of the GRK family, GRK7, was cloned in fish !!!REF!!! and mammals !!!REF!!!. GRK1 or rhodopsin kinase together with GRK7 are members of the same GRK family that are found in the retina !!!REFs!!!. GRK2 and GRK3 were the first cloned GRKs and comprise the family of β-adrenergic receptor kinases (βARKs) !!!REFs!!!. While GRK1 is a cytosolic enzyme that translocates to membrane by isoprenylation !!!REFs!!!, agonist-induced translocation of GRK2 and 3 to membrane fractions requires the binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate and βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins !!!REF!!!. The third family of GRKs comprises the cloned GRKs 4, 5 and 6 !!!REFs!!!. While most GRK5 appears to be constitutively associated with membranes !!!REF!!!, GRK4 and 6 have palmitoylation sites at their caboxy-terminal that seems to be responsible for their membrane localization !!!REF!!!. Localization of these enzymes was mostly performed by Northern blotting analysis of mRNA from several tissues. mRNAs for GRK1 and GRK7 are observed only in the retina !!!REFs!!! and high expression of mRNA for GRK4 is observed only in testis !!!REF!!!. mRNA for GRK2, 3, 5 and 6 are ubiquitously expressed !!!REFs!!!. In the nervous system, few studies have characterized the distribution of these enzymes by immunohistochemistry. While GRK7 was localized only in cones of the retina !!!REFs!!!, GRK1 was shown to be expressed in rods or both rods and cones of the mammalian retina !!!REF!!!, in a specie specific pattern !!!REF!!!. In the chicken retina, a novel GRK1 was cloned and shown to be expressed in both types of photoreceptors !!!REF!!!. In the rat brain, GRKs 2 and 3 were shown to be localized at synapses in several areas of this tissue !!!REFs!!!. Putative receptors that can be phosphorylated by GRKs were identified by overexpressing these proteins or their dominant-negative forms in cell lines transfected with G protein-coupled receptors !!!REFs!!!. Although a large body of evidences concerning the mechanism of activation of these enzymes and their role in receptor desensitization was obtained using these preparations, the specificity of the interaction between native receptors and GRKs is still elusive. Recently, some studies performing overexpression of GRKs in specific tissues or using knockout mice characterized a preferential interaction between some native receptors and specific GRKs. A preferential interaction between odorant receptors and GRK3 and between β-adrenergic receptors and GRK2 was observed in olfactory system and in heart, respectively !!!REFs!!!. The retina is an excellent model for neurochemical studies of the nervous system since its development, morphology and electrophysiology is relatively well characterized. Moreover, several G protein-coupled receptors like dopamine D1, D2, D4 and D5 receptors !!!REF!!!, muscarinic M2, M3 and M4 receptors !!!REF!!!, adenosine A1 and A2 receptors !!!REFs!!!, metabotropic glutamate receptors !!!REF!!!, among others, were characterized in this tissue. Agonist-induced desensitization as well as desensitization during development of some receptors such as dopamine D1 receptors !!!REFs!!! or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors !!!REFs!!! were also described in this tissue. The main purpose of the present work was to characterize, by immunohistochemistry, the presence or not of GRKs 2, 3 and 5 in the avian retina and try to correlate their pattern of expression with the GPCR systems which were already described in this tissue. Our results reveal that, while specific immunolabeling for GRK2 is ubiquitously distributed over neurons and processes in this tissue, GRK3 and GRK5 immunoreactivities are mostly found over inner retinal neurons and Müller cells, respectively. Immunoreactivity for GRK3 and GRK5 is also present in the inner plexiform layer, but showing a different pattern of expression in this layer.  Orphanin FQ (OFQ), a member of endogenous opioid peptides, is the endogenous ligand for orphan opioid receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor. Numerous studies demonstrated that the action of OFQ on pain modulation depends on the site of administration, and the consensus opinion is that OFQ exhibits pronociceptive activity in the brain !!!REF!!!. It was reported that preproorphanin FQ (ppOFQ) mRNA and OFQ immunoreactivity were both expressed in areas involved in nociception, e.g., nucleus of raphe magnus (NRM), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) !!!REFs!!!. These findings suggested that this opioid peptide might play a role in the modulation of nociceptive signals. It has been shown that electroacupuncture (EA) had analgesic effect in neuropathic pain rats, and it was also well known that EA analgesia is mediated by endogenous opioids and other neurotransmitters in the central nervous system !!!REF!!!. Some studies showed that OFQ release in the lateral ventricle was changed after EA treatment in rats, demonstrating that OFQ in the brain was involved in EA analgesia !!!REF!!!. There is no report on the possible changes of OFQ in the brain after EA administration in the rats with neuropathic pain. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate changes of ppOFQ mRNA expression and OFQ immunoreactivity in NRM after EA treatment in the chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rats.  The hippocampal formation is considered an important structure for the formation of declarative categories of memory !!!REF!!!. It has been demonstrated by electrophysiological investigations !!!REFs!!! that both stimulation of the amygdala and stress-related stimuli can lead to a reinforcement of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which, in turn, is regarded as one of the key mechanisms of memory formation. Behavioral experiments in animals !!!REF!!! as well as studies in humans including clinical investigations support the view that amygdala activity enhances long-term memory !!!REFs!!!. Major anatomical projections from the amygdala to the hippocampal formation, which includes the entorhinal cortex (ECl), dentate gyrus, hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum (see !!!REF!!!) originate in the lateral, the basal and the anterior basomedial (or accessory basal) nucleus (see !!!REF!!! and !!!REF!!! for discussion of the nomenclature), as well as in the posterior cortical nucleus, the periamygdaloid cortex and the amygdalo-hippocampal area !!!REFs!!!. In particular, the lateral nucleus (LA) and the anterior basomedial nucleus (BMa) of the amygdala receive a prominent projection from thalamic nuclei closely related to the acoustic thalamus !!!REFs!!!. These thalamic nuclei were called the posterior paralaminar nuclei !!!REF!!! and include the posterior intralaminar nucleus (PIN), the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN), the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGm), and the peripeduncular nucleus (PP). The projection of PIN, SGN, MGm, and PP are the major extralemniscal pathway by which sensory information reach the amygdala. Experimental work has demonstrated a pivotal role of the thalamic projection to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala for the fast acquisition of the fear-potentiated acoustic startle reaction and the formation of emotional memories !!!REF!!!. The basomedial nucleus of the amygdala appears to contribute significantly to the induction and maintenance of LTP in the dentate gyrus !!!REF!!! and is thought to modulate the formation of long-term declarative memory !!!REF!!!. On this basis we were interested in verifying whether the amygdalo-hippocampal projection cells of the basomedial nucleus are contacted directly by thalamic neurons.  Largely based on the evidence that parallel fibers are orthogonal to the dendritic planes of the Purkinje cells, Eccles et al. !!!REFs!!! have long proposed that beams of parallel fibers provide major sources of excitation for the Purkinje cells. This implies that an important function of the cerebellar synaptic circuitry is for the Purkinje cells to integrate information from parallel fibers. The massiveness of the parallel fiber system has been confirmed by morphometrical data provided by Palkovitz et al. !!!REFs!!! and more recently by Napper and Harvey !!!REF!!! and Harvey and Napper !!!REF!!! as well as Pichitponchai et al. !!!REF!!!. These investigators have suggested that the synapses between granule cells and Purkinje cells (gcPc synapses), and in particular, the synapses between parallel fibers and the Purkinje cells (pfPc synapses), are the major type of synapses in the molecular layer of the cerebellum as they far outnumber all other cerebellar synapses. Although the numerical superiority of pfPc synapses implies that they may be functionally significant, this functional significance must also be predicated upon the length of parallel fibers where the pfPc synapses reside. The length of parallel fibers is clearly critical considering the functional organization of the granule cells. Based on electrophysiological recordings in the somatosensory area in the cerebellar hemisphere, Welker and co-workers !!!REF!!! have proposed that the granule cell layer has a fractured mosaic organization pattern consisting of a large number of patches of granule cells. Granule cells within a given patch share closely their afferent inputs and therefore display similar response patterns to afferent stimuli. The shape of a patch is irregular and the dimension of the patch (, , or ) is typically of the order of 2–300μm !!!REF!!!. If parallel fibers are much shorter than the dimensions of these granule cell patches, then a Purkinje cell can only process information from granule cells within a single patch. But if parallel fibers are long enough to span a number of patches, then Purkinje cell information processing will involve numerous patches, providing a potential mechanism within the cerebellar cortex for information integration such as that necessary for complex multi-joint movement coordination. The length of parallel fibers is therefore an important parameter to the function of the cerebellar cortex. Many investigators including Palay and Palay !!!REF!!! and Ito !!!REF!!!, however, have long remarked that parallel fiber length is difficult to measure. We have summarized four decades of parallel fiber research into two main methods !!!REF!!!. The first is a population method that extracts parallel fiber length from visual inspection of images of a population of parallel fibers from either histological staining or autoradiography !!!REFs!!!. We have also included the determination of parallel fiber length by evoked potential in this first type !!!REF!!!. The population method can over-estimate the parallel fiber length if many shorter fibers are hidden in the shadow of longer ones. Moreover, any staggering of parallel fibers should further worsen this over-estimation. The second method is a stereological estimation of the length of parallel fibers based upon the volume of the molecular layer, the fraction of the molecular layer occupied by the parallel fibers, and the number and diameter of parallel fibers !!!REFs!!!. The accuracy of the stereological method depends upon many additional pieces of data. There is also a modified population approach in which many parallel fibers are stained but experimental observations are made on single parallel fibers !!!REFs!!!. Other than our own, these studies have focused on the synaptic varicosities along the parallel fibers. Direct length measurement of !!!REF!!! single parallel fibers in the modified population approach is still difficult because a parallel fiber (several thousand microns long) will be cut into many pieces in histological sections (∼100μm thick). When bundles of parallel fiber pieces are presented in many sections, reconstructing the fibers for length measurements is impractical. Given the difficulties of the population approach and the stereological method, we propose a stochastic method which allows us to obtain the mean length of parallel fibers by approaching single parallel fibers without having to see them in whole !!!REF!!!. Our stochastic method is based on the Copernican principle (see footnote 1) for analyzing the length of single stochastic events. For length measurement of parallel fibers, the Copernican principle declares that there is nothing special about starting the measurement at any one spot on any one parallel fiber. To implement the stochastic method, we make use of the Golgi method which stains ∼1% of all parallel fibers, each in its entirety !!!REF!!!. Conceptually, we treat each stained single axon as a one-dimensional stochastic event. Within a given cerebellar region,where mean is the mean length, sum the summed length of all parallel fibers, and pf the number of parallel fibers. Since each fiber has two ends, or pf = 1/2 e, where e is the number of parallel fiber ends. !!!REF!!! can be re-written as The form of !!!REF!!!, considered with the Copernican principle, suggests to us a protocol for measuring the mean length of parallel fibers. We would begin by randomly picking a single parallel fiber , start randomly at a point on the fiber, randomly pick a direction, and proceed to move along the fiber while measuring the distance traced. After moving a distance of , we either reach the true end of the fiber or come to the surface of the section where the fiber is cut. Regardless, the distance is recorded. We then start the cycle again by picking another fiber. After many cycles, we sum up the total observed distance or Σ as sum, o and also the total number of observed true ends e,o (not counting the cut ends c,o). Following the formalism of !!!REF!!!, we define the observed mean length mean,o as, In !!!REF!!!, we count the number of true ends but do not physically measure the whole length of single parallel fibers. Thus, the stochastic method circumvents the difficulties of piecing together single parallel fibers from many sections. Note that !!!REF!!! only requires the number of true ends. Since cutting parallel fibers into segments only produces more cut ends, we assume that segmentation of parallel fibers during histology should not affect the estimation of the mean length. The correctness of this assumption will be examined in the present study. We have applied the stochastic method to obtain parallel fiber length in the F344 rats !!!REF!!!, the C57BL/6 mice !!!REFs!!!, and more recently the BALB/C mice (data not yet published). Whether these initial applications of the stochastic method in F344 rats should be viewed skeptically or as a cautious success, it is clear that the method itself needs validation. To validate our stochastic method, we must apply it to parallel fibers whose lengths are known. Moreover, the length information must be primary or absolute and not just secondarily derived or measured by another method which may itself need validation. This is a difficult and circular task. Computational simulation provides a solution in which virtual fibers with known lengths can be created and their lengths then estimated by the stochastic method, thus circumventing the circular nature of the validation task. In this study, each of the measuring steps in light microscopy (LM) is programmed into C++. We can randomly pick a virtual fiber, start randomly at a point on the fiber, randomly pick a direction, and proceed to trace the fiber while measuring the distance traced. The virtual fibers are also deliberately cut to simulate histology. The major objective of the computational simulation is to examine the accuracy of the stochastic method. Our main findings are: (1) the simulation generates rapidly converging values of mean,o. Convergence occurs at encountering ∼10 fiber ends, which was also the case in our experimental results reported previously !!!REFs!!!. This makes the method highly efficient. (2) Cutting the fibers causes an over-estimation on the mean length. The over-estimation, defined as mean,o/ mean, increases progressively as parallel fibers are cut into shorter pieces but it never exceeds two. The relationship between the segmentation of parallel fibers and the over-estimation ( mean,o/ mean) is significant. First, it defines the upper bound of the over-estimation of our method. Second, as it will become clear later, this relationship can be used to derive the true mean length mean, from the observed length mean,o, and the mean segmental length seg,mean (which is Σ divided by the sum of e,o and c,o). Both mean,o and seg,mean are therefore measurable parameters in our microscopy protocol !!!REFs!!!. For these reasons above, it becomes important to understand the relationship of the over-estimation and seg,mean. In particular, why does the over-estimation vary with the severity of parallel fiber segmentation? Why only between one and two? We therefore also derive analytically the relationship between the over-estimation factor and the degree of severity of parallel fiber segmentation based on probability theory considerations. The analytically derived relationship between the over-estimation and seg,mean is in agreement with the results from our computational simulation, thus further validating our experimental methodology. In addition, it is during this derivation that we come to determine that the over-estimation factor turns out to be a consequence of one of the steps in our statistical sampling process.  After conditioning, an initially neutral stimulus which has been associated with reward becomes meaningful to an animal. In the present study, we used an olfactory associative learning task to determine the brain areas involved in stimulus processing according to its acquired biological significance. The olfactory system is well-suited for studying memory processes because rats trained with odorous stimuli can efficiently acquire learning sets !!!REF!!!. Our aim was to investigate if a differential activation in olfactory-related brain areas would occur when rats are stimulated by an odor which predicts reward or not. In a previous report, we observed that events not directly related to learning and memory, such as sniffing and locomotor activities in the training apparatus can induce a substantial cerebral Fos expression !!!REF!!!. Consequently, we chose to stimulate rats by the significant odor out of the initial training context. As the olfactory bulb could play a role in memory processes !!!REF!!!, we focussed our investigation on cortical areas. The main target of the olfactory bulb is the piriform cortex (PCx) !!!REF!!!. Several range of evidence suggest that this paleocortex is a site of learning-induced plasticity and could be involved in olfactory learning !!!REFs!!!. Long-term potentiation was observed in the PCx both in vitro !!!REF!!! and in vivo during an olfactory discrimination task !!!REF!!!. Olfactory conditioning also modified neuronal excitability on PCx slices !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that olfactory learning induced differential electrical responses between the anterior (PCx-a) and the posterior (PCx-p), subdivisions of the PCx !!!REFs!!!. It has also been shown that acquisition of an olfactory discrimination induces a differential Fos expression within the PCx according to the learning rate of the animal !!!REF!!!. Several other brain areas could be involved in olfactory memory. PCx is a source of projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex which densely innervates the hippocampus which is known to be implicated in memory processes !!!REF!!!. PCx is also reciprocally connected to cortical areas such as the ventro-lateral orbitofrontal (VLO) and infralimbic (IL) cortices !!!REF!!!. It has been shown that the orbitofrontal cortex could play a role in stimulus–reinforcer association !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the infralimbic region could also sustain integration of reward cues in motivated animals performing a memory task !!!REF!!!. Since increased expression is linked to neural activity !!!REF!!!, including that associated with learning !!!REFs!!!, we performed a quantitative analysis of Fos immunoreactivity induced by olfactory stimulation which acquired, or not, a reward value after learning of a discrimination task.  Neurosteroid hormone vitamin D plays an important role in the nervous system including differentiation, regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, modulation of neurotrophins release and activity of key brain genes and enzymes of neurotransmitter metabolism !!!REFs!!!. The functions of vitamin D are mediated through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) !!!REFs!!!. VDR gene expression has been demonstrated in neurons and glial cells !!!REF!!!. VDR are widespread in the brain and the spinal cord including the areas involved in the regulation of motor activity and behaviour !!!REFs!!!. Several studies outline the possible role of vitamin D and VDR in regulation of motor behaviour. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is often accompanied by tetany, seizures and other motor disorders !!!REF!!!. In animals, vitamin D deficit produces behavioural alterations including decreased exploration and maze performance !!!REF!!!. Together, this evidences that vitamin D system may be an important factor controlling motor functions in animals and humans. Various VDR disorders may therefore be a risk factor for abnormal locomotion in both humans and animals – an area of research, which is becoming increasingly important. Since motor abnormalities have been reported for a number of mutant mice !!!REFs!!!, transgenic and knockout mice represent an increasingly popular tool to study the role of gene functions in motor behaviour. To examine the link between vitamin D-related disorders and motor activity, we studied VDR knockout mice (VDR-KO) currently available for biomedical research !!!REFs!!!. The importance of assessing the status of locomotory system is now widely recognised as a key part of behavioural phenotyping of mutant animals !!!REFs!!!. Because, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published data describing motor behavioural profiles of VDR-KO mice, in our research we wanted to assess the motor behaviours of these mutant animals in detail. Here, we present data based on screening of VDR-KO mice in a battery of behavioural tests assessing their general motor activity, visual abilities and motor performance.  The imbalance between reactive-oxygen species (ROS) and the generation of free radicals is involved in the pathogenesis of most of the neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) !!!REFs!!!. According to McIlory et al., apolipoprotein E (apo E), α-2 microglobulin, very low density lipoprotein receptor, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) are shown to be risk factors for AD pathogenesis !!!REF!!!. Also, the brains of AD patients are typically associated with attacks by free radicals (e.g., damage to DNA, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and advanced glycosylation end products) !!!REF!!!. Among the free radicals, the lipoperoxidation phenomena could have a major influence on the pathogenesis of the disease. Justly, neuronal death occurs according to a process of apoptosis that is related to an increase in lipid peroxidation !!!REF!!!. Lipid-peroxidation forms primary- or secondary-end products like conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, gaseous alkanes, and prostaglandin F2-like products !!!REF!!!. Isoprostane F2α-III (iPF2α-III or class III) and 8-isoprostaglandin F2α (8-isoPGF2α), particularly are created as major products by free-radical catalyzed peroxidation of esterified AA in membrane phospholipids. They are also minor products of the activity of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in response to stimuli such as collagen, thrombin, or arachidonate !!!REF!!!. Recent efforts focused on determining biomarkers to screen for the susceptibility of AD, other dementias, and age-matched controls. Other studies have quantified levels of Aβ42, tau and F2-isoprostanes in the biological fluid, and have addressed their utility as biomarkers for AD. The levels of F2-isoprostanes and tau in CSF were found to be elevated in AD patients when compared to that of age-matched controls !!!REFs!!!. The concentration of 8-isoPGF2α also increased significantly in the frontal and temporal poles of the brains of AD patients !!!REF!!!. In this study, we measured the urinary levels of F2-isoprostanes, PGF2α, PGF2β, and 8-isoPGF2α, in AD patients and in healthy controls using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Then, we discussed the alteration of urinary F2-isoprostanes in AD disease and its usefulness as an index of oxidative stress in AD.  In accordance with the general notion that aging is associated with a loss of cognitive functions, many studies have shown an age-related decline in cognitive performance in rodents !!!REFs!!!. Most of these studies used cross-sectional designs, which are likely to be associated with various limitations (see !!!REFs!!!). A small number of studies applied a longitudinal design to examine the effects of aging on cognitive performance. Surprisingly, spatial learning and memory performance (Morris task and radial maze) appeared to be unaffected by age if animals were tested on a task that they had acquired earlier in life !!!REFs!!!, even if the first acquisition was run at old age !!!REF!!!. If, however, the task !!!REFs!!! or the environment !!!REF!!! was changed, age-related cognitive impairments were observed. These data clearly indicate that age-related spatial orientation deficits can be found in naı̈ve old rats, but only under specific conditions in experienced animals. In contrast to the Morris and radial arm maze task that assesses spatial reference and/or spatial working memory, the delayed non-matching to position (DNMTP) task assesses working memory in an operant conditioning chamber. In previous cross-sectional studies an age-related impairment in this task has been found !!!REFs!!!. However, no longitudinal studies have been reported in which the performance was repeatedly tested in this type of task. Since working memory cannot be generalized across trials, because it is trial-dependent by definition (e.g., !!!REF!!!), we used the DNMTP task for a longitudinal study in aging rats. Since the rate of forgetting in the operant DNMTP task is faster than in a radial maze task, it could be argued that the performance in this task is more susceptible to aging than the spatial radial maze task. We used aged hybrid Fischer 344 × Brown Norway rats which are especially suited for aging studies since they show less age-specific pathologies !!!REFs!!!, they show low biological variability !!!REF!!!, and because this hybrid rat is one of the animal models selected for aging research by the National Institute of Aging !!!REF!!!. It has been reported that the 50% mortality of this strain is about 33 months !!!REF!!!. In addition to the behavioural measures, we measured choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus after behavioural testing. Although different studies failed to find a correlation between ChAT activity and cognitive performance in rats (e.g., !!!REFs!!!), such a correlation study has not yet been performed between ChAT activity and DNMTP performance in aging rats. However, a correlation between hippocampal ChAT and DNMTP performance was observed in a deficit model !!!REF!!!. GFAP can be regarded as a marker for astrocytes and it has been shown that this marker is increased in aged rats !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the level of hippocampal GFAP has been found to predict the learning performance in a Morris task !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we only evaluated the performance of one group of rats and did not make a direct comparison with young or aged test-naı̈ve animals. Consequently, our data are limited to the effects of aging on the performance in the DNMTP task and the relationship between biochemical markers and performance in well-trained old rats.  Since the report of patient H.M. who showed persistent amnesia despite preserved cognitive function other than declarative or episodic memory after resection of bilateral medial temporal lobes (MTLs) !!!REF!!!, it has been confirmed that damage to the MTL can cause a selective disturbance of declarative or episodic memory. Furthermore, MTL activity is correlated with memory formation performance !!!REFs!!!. Significant hippocampal activation can be observed during retrieval accompanied by conscious recollection !!!REF!!!, and activation in the PHG/fusiform gyrus occurs during successful recognition !!!REF!!!. However, documented observation on MTL substructures activated during various memory tasks are inconsistent. For example, Lepage et al. reported that the anterior and posterior MTLs are associated with episodic encoding and retrieval, respectively, as seen by meta-analysis of PET studies !!!REF!!!. However, according to a meta-analysis by Schacter and Wagner, the activation of anterior and posterior MTLs could be observed in a PET study whereas predominantly posterior MTL activation only was observed in an fMRI study during encoding !!!REF!!!. Positive !!!REF!!! and negative !!!REFs!!! findings to the latter hypothesis that encoding activates predominantly posterior MTL were reported in fMRI studies. Although relatively few fMRI studies have reported MTL activation during retrieval, a recent fMRI study suggested that the retrieval of verbal stimuli activates the middle and posterior hippocampus more strongly than the anterior hippocampus !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, the anterior PHG and hippocampus are involved in the retrieval of visuospatial scenes !!!REF!!!. Successful memory encoding is related to the left PHG and subiculm !!!REF!!!, the left PHG and fusiform gyrus !!!REFs!!!, the left perirhinal cortex and hippocampus !!!REF!!!, bilateral PHG !!!REF!!!, the left anterior PHG !!!REF!!!, the left anterior hippocampus and PHG !!!REF!!! and the bilateral entorhinal cortex !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the contributions of separate MTL substructures to memory encoding and retrieval and specifically memory performance need to be further studied. Moreover, since encoding and retrieval processes affect memory performance, analysis for one condition may be inconclusive. Recent studies indicate that some regions activated during encoding are reactivated during retrieval !!!REFs!!!, and that MTL may trigger this reactivation process !!!REFs!!!. A recent electrophysiological examination that examined the activity of MTL neurons in patients implanted with microelectrodes during encoding and retrieval of paired associates also suggested that some MTL neurons activated during encoding are activated during retrieval !!!REF!!!. These findings indicate that the regions commonly active during encoding and retrieval will include the regions related to such reactivation process. It is probable that memory performance is affected by the effectiveness of the reactivation process. Therefore, examining encoding and retrieval processes together will complement the analysis of the single condition. On these backgrounds, we investigated neural substrates that affect the performance of auditory verbal memory. The regions whose activities are correlated with later recall performance among individuals for a given task were examined (between-subjects correlation analysis), whereas most previous studies examined the regions whose activities are correlated with later recall performance of a given subject in the same or different task (within subjects correlation analysis). These two methods are complementary as previously described !!!REF!!!. Since there is no reason to suppose the relationship between neural activity and memory performance will invariably be a positive one !!!REF!!!, regions whose activities are negatively correlated with memory performance were also explored, although there are numerous difficulties in the interpretation of the results. In addition, few studies have addressed this issue !!!REFs!!!. We selected related paired-associates learning for the task to be performed instead of a more refined one, because this task is commonly used in clinical examinations. Therefore, our results will be directly informative for the practice of clinical neurology.  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious disabling neurological disorder affecting young Caucasian individuals, with an age of onset typically ranging from 18 to 40 years. Females account for approximately 60% of MS cases !!!REF!!! with the incidence of MS in Northern Europe, Canada, and the Northern United States being approximately 10 new cases per year per 100,000 persons (between the ages of 20 and 50 years). With the exception of trauma, MS remains the most frequent cause of neurological disability for young adults. The central nervous system (CNS) in MS is affected with patches of myelin degeneration produced by multifocal inflammatory events. The disease is disseminated in time and space, with MS classified into types, based on the clinical course namely relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS), secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS), and primary-progressive MS (PP-MS) !!!REF!!!. Studies indicate that MS has a genetic component with 30% of monozygotic twins developing the disease compared to only 4.7% in dizygotic twins !!!REF!!!. The HLA gene complex has been shown to be associated with MS !!!REF!!!, but the HLA contribution does not appear to explain all the susceptibility. Other genes have been found to be related with disease severity including the () gene !!!REF!!!, and Fc-receptor () genes !!!REF!!!. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical agent with wide biological functions. It is produced by a group of enzymes called nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS catalyses the production of NO and l-citrulline from l-arginine, O2 and NADPH. There are three isoforms of NOS: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). The last isoform is a calcium independent enzyme responsible for producing high output and long-lasting release of NO, exceeding the NO production level of nNOS and eNOS isoforms. Expression of iNOS is under the regulation of several cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) !!!REF!!! and its function is part of the macrophage-mediated response to infectious agents. Activated macrophages residing within MS brain lesions have been demonstrated !!!REF!!!. Within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), NO products have been found at a higher concentration in MS patients compared to healthy control subjects !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, increased iNOS activity has been detected in the CSF of MS patients with high NO concentration levels correlating with disease activity !!!REFs!!!. In animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, increased CNS mRNA levels of iNOS have been demonstrated along with high levels of cytokines, particularly involved in iNOS activation !!!REF!!!. Interestingly, this up-regulation of iNOS in EAE is concomitant with a decrease in Ca2+-dependent NOS activity of eNOS and nNOS !!!REF!!!. In a human MS study, iNOS mRNA and iNOS enzymatic activity have been detected in MS plaque lesions !!!REF!!!. Inducible NOS activity resides in activated and differentiated monocytes in MS patients suggesting a role for monocyte iNOS in the autoimmune response underlying disease pathogenesis !!!REF!!!. The activity of iNOS has detrimental effects on oligodendrocytes, cells responsible for the myelination of neurons in the CNS !!!REF!!!. Nitric oxide might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of MS, and alterations of the iNOS gene could possibly have an impact on the disease. The human iNOS (NOS2A) gene has been localized to chromosome 17q11-2-q12, a locus close to a region linked with MS on chromosome 17q21-q22 !!!REF!!!. The gene consists of 27 exons and is about 40kb in length !!!REF!!!. To determine the possible involvement of polymorphisms of iNOS in the pathogenesis of MS, a bi-allelic tetranucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the human iNOS gene has been examined by employing an association study approach in a group of MS patients and age/sex-matched controls.  In both basic and clinical neuroscience, there are many instances where it would be important to know how changes in neural activity in a given brain area affect neural activity in other brain regions. Such knowledge, pertaining to the effective connectivity between brain regions, would usefully complement information about their anatomical and functional connectivity !!!REFs!!!. In animals, issues of effective connectivity have been addressed by electrically stimulating a given brain region while recording neuronal firing in a target area !!!REF!!!. In humans, a promising approach to studying effective connectivity is to combine transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with functional neuroimaging. TMS can be used to directly perturb the activity of accessible cortical areas, and functional neuroimaging can reveal which other brain areas are indirectly affected by the perturbation !!!REF!!!. Over the past few years, several studies have employed TMS simultaneously with positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) to explore the effective connectivity of selected cortical areas. The primary motor cortex (M1) has been most frequently investigated. For example, an early TMS/PET study of left M1 showed increased regional cerebral blood-flow (rCBF) at the stimulated site, in the ipsi and contralateral somatosensory cortex, in the left premotor area (M2) and right supplementary motor area (SMA), together with a deactivation of contralateral primary motor cortex !!!REF!!!. A more recent TMS/fMRI study of left M1 reported bilateral activation of M2 and SMA associated with deactivation of right M1 !!!REF!!!. Finally, a TMS/hd-EEG study of M1 found activation of ipsilateral premotor cortex a few ms after TMS, followed by contralateral M1 activation at latencies compatible with transcallosal conduction delays !!!REF!!!. Despite some inconsistencies, these and other studies have shown that TMS of a given brain region can indeed produce activation and deactivation in anatomically connected cortical areas. Much work remains to be done, however, to obtain a comprehensive picture of brain effective connectivity through combined TMS/neuroimaging approaches. For example, with one exception !!!REF!!!, activation patterns produced by TMS of different cortical areas have not been compared within the same study. Moreover, only a few studies have found evidence for a possible activation of subcortical structures !!!REFs!!!. In this study, we employed a simultaneous TMS/PET paradigm to explore differences in the activation patterns produced by stimulation of different cortical regions within the same experimental paradigm. Moreover, we wished to evaluate the extent to which TMS of different cortical areas can produce trans-synaptic activation of subcortical circuits. Based on pilot results indicating an increased sensitivity of [17F]-[CH3F] ([17F]-fluoromethane) compared to [15O]-H2O for imaging subcortical structures !!!REF!!!, we selected [17F]-fluoromethane (F-17) as the radiotracer for our TMS/PET protocol. The blood-flow tracer fluoromethane !!!REFs!!! was originally labeled with F-18, which has a 2-h half-life. In the current work, F-17 ( 1/2 = 64s) was used as its shorter half-life compared to F-18 is better matched to blood-flow dynamics, and also permits more frequent repeat studies. The change in radioisotope has no effect on the physiological or chemical properties of the tracer since both are fluorine. We then stimulated four different cortical areas—left primary motor cortex, right primary visual cortex, and left and right prefrontal areas—in each subject in the course of the same PET session. We found that each stimulation site yielded a different pattern of activation/deactivation that was consistent with its anatomical connectivity. Moreover, we found that TMS of prefrontal and motor cortical areas gave rise to trans-synaptic activation of subcortical circuits.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is critical for the generation of circadian rhythms in mammals. GABA is the most prominent neurotransmitter in the SCN and has been the focus of numerous investigations in nocturnal mammals. Recent evidence from diurnal rodents suggests that the actions of GABA may differ between diurnal (day-active) and nocturnal (night-active) animals !!!REFs!!!. Specifically, activation of GABAA receptors with muscimol within the SCN causes phase advances during the subjective day in nocturnal rodents !!!REF!!!, whereas similar treatment with muscimol causes phase delays in diurnal rodents !!!REF!!!. Further, muscimol-induced phase shifts are significantly decreased by concomitant light exposure in hamsters !!!REF!!!, while light has no discernable affect on muscimol-induced phase delays in diurnal rodents at the same time of day !!!REF!!!. In contrast, during the night, SCN GABAA receptor activation has similar effects in diurnal and nocturnal rodents, inhibiting light-induced phase shifts !!!REFs!!!. In hamsters, activation of GABAB receptors in the SCN with baclofen has similar actions as GABAA receptor activation with muscimol, namely, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen inhibits the phase-shifting effects of light at night !!!REF!!!. In addition, there is also evidence that baclofen induces phase advances during the daytime !!!REF!!!. Activation of GABAA receptors affects circadian phase differently in diurnal than nocturnal rodents, but this difference is restricted to the daytime !!!REFs!!!. The following studies aimed to determine if other aspects of the SCN GABA system, namely the effects of GABAB receptor activation on circadian phase, differ between diurnal and nocturnal rodents. These studies utilized the unstriped Nile grass rat (), a diurnal rodent model, as well as nocturnal rodents (Syrian hamsters, ), to determine how GABAB receptor activation in the SCN affects circadian phase.  In the CNS, adenosine is known to serve as a neuromodulator in a variety of physiological functions such as neuronal protection from ischemia and pain transmission (for review see !!!REFs!!!). For instance, adenosine plays a role in inhibiting nociceptive transmission in the spinal dorsal horn, particularly in the substantia gelatinosa (SG; lamina II of Rexed) (for review see !!!REFs!!!). There is much evidence supporting this idea. Intrathecally-administered adenosine analogues produce antinociception (!!!REF!!!; for review see !!!REFs!!!). Braas et al. !!!REF!!! have shown the presence of adenosine-like immunoreactivity at a high level in the rat SG. Binding and in situ hybridization studies have demonstrated that adenosine receptors are present in the spinal dorsal horn !!!REFs!!!. Adenosine decreased the spontaneous and electrically-evoked release of l-glutamate to SG neurons !!!REFs!!!. Although adenosine is well-known to hyperpolarize membranes of CNS neurons !!!REFs!!!, this action has not been fully examined yet in SG neurons. Extracellular adenosine is regulated by a variety of mechanisms (for review see !!!REFs!!!). For instance, adenosine is either released from neurons and glial cells through nucleoside transporters or produced by a cleavage of ATP released from them (for review see !!!REF!!!). The adult rat SG contains a high density of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter designated as rENT1, which equilibrates the concentration of adenosine across plasma membranes without a dependence on ATP or ionic gradients to transport adenosine (!!!REFs!!!; for review see !!!REFs!!!). With respect to adenosine metabolism, adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to produce inosine and ammonia !!!REF!!!, and adenosine kinase (AK) phosphorylates adenosine to 5′-AMP !!!REF!!!; these enzymes are present in the adult rat dorsal horn !!!REFs!!!. It is possible that such regulating systems play a role in the modulation by adenosine of synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn, but this has not been thoroughly addressed yet in the SG. Focusing on a postsynaptic action of adenosine, a detail of its action on holding currents in SG neurons of adult rat spinal cord slices and interference of its action with processes removing adenosine from neuronal environment were investigated using the blind whole-cell patch-clamp technique.  The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) plays a pivotal role in central control of blood pressure !!!REFs!!!, and it exhibits a unique diversity of neurotransmitters and their receptors. The NTS receives sensory information from receptors of various modalities, including the baroreceptors in carotid sinus and aortic arch. The perikarya of these visceral afferent neurons are localized in the inferior sensory ganglia of the vagus (nodose) and glossopharyngeal (petrosal) nerves. Furthermore, NTS establishes neural connections with other cardiovascular-related areas such as the ventral medulla and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino-acid peptide that was initially described to be generated by alternative splicing of the calcitonin gene !!!REF!!!. CGRP is found in neurons of the central and peripheral nerve systems, playing a role in many neuronal functions, including the control of blood pressure !!!REF!!!. It has been described that the expression of CGRP mRNA in neurons of the nodose and petrosal ganglia !!!REF!!! and CGRP immunoreactive terminals project from those ganglia to the NTS !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, hypotension and bradycardia were observed after CGRP injection in the NTS !!!REF!!!, which suggests the involvement of the peptide in central cardiovascular control. Evidence has been also obtained that the level of CGRP is decreased in brain areas related to blood pressure control in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) !!!REF!!!. It seems that the decreased CGRP in the SHR can be restored after local nerve growth factor administration, what then triggers a fall in blood pressure levels in these animals !!!REF!!!. These features further indicate a role of CGRP in the central mechanisms related to blood pressure control. Galanin (GAL) is a 29-amino-acid neuropeptide widely distributed in the central nervous system !!!REF!!!, including areas related to blood pressure control !!!REF!!!. GAL immunoreactive perikarya and GAL mRNA were described in nodose and petrosal ganglia !!!REFs!!!. GAL-immunoreactive terminals and cell bodies as well as mRNA were found in both NTS and PVN of rats !!!REF!!!. Chen et al. !!!REF!!! showed that PVN galaninergic projections to NTS suppress baroreceptor reflex responses, giving evidence on the involvement of the neuropeptide in cardiovascular regulation. Furthermore, it was observed that intracisternal administration of CGRP, at nanomolar range, was able to trigger hypotensive responses in rats !!!REF!!! giving further indication that GAL might participate in the control of blood pressure. Finally, Kunkler et al. !!!REF!!! showed increased content of GAL in the NTS and locus coeruleus of the hypertensive rat. Although studies have described a possible role of CGRP and GAL in the central mechanisms of blood pressure control, changes of peptides synthesis in response to a hypertensive stimulus is not well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in CGRP and GAL mRNA expression in the NTS, PVN, nodose and petrosal ganglia following experimental hypertension. We have employed the subdiaphragmatic aortic coarctation in order to analyse the effect of acute (2h) and sustained hypertension (3 and 7 days) in rats !!!REFs!!!, which might clarify the involvement of both peptides in the establishment/maintenance of high blood pressure. Using this experimental model of hypertension, we can avoid the undesirable side effects of drugs normally used to induce a hypertensive state.  Electrolytic lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) result in aphagia and an increased rate of body weight loss !!!REF!!!. In addition, electrolytic LH lesions are accompanied by a rise in core body temperature, or hyperthermia, which is hypothesized to contribute to a metabolic alteration that may be responsible for the increased rate of weight loss !!!REFs!!!. Rats given electrolytic LH lesions show a higher rate of whole body thermogenesis compared to sham-lesioned animals !!!REFs!!!. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is a mediator of thermogenesis !!!REF!!!, plays a role in producing this temperature increase !!!REFs!!!. Electrolytic LH lesions increase the firing rate and temperature of BAT !!!REFs!!!. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors attenuate the hyperthermia produced by electrolytic LH lesions, and this attenuation is also associated with a reduction in BAT firing and temperature, suggesting prostaglandin to be a mediator of these effects !!!REFs!!!. Because electrolytic lesions destroy neurons and axonal fibers that traverse the nucleus, it is unclear whether the temperature increase is due to injury of intrinsic LH neurons or fibers coursing through the LH. The use of knife cuts, which selectively disrupt fibers of passage and leave intrinsic neurons intact, allows the contribution of fibers of passage to be assessed independently of intrinsic neurons. In a study conducted by Gunion et al. !!!REF!!!, knife cuts were made to fibers on the anterior, lateral, medial, and posterior borders of the LH. Only anterior cuts produced a significant elevation in core body temperature. The majority of anterior LH fibers travel to and through the lateral preoptic area, so these anterior cuts sever fibers connecting the LH and preoptic area (POA) !!!REF!!!. Damage to the POA also produces an increase in core body temperature, an effect that is attenuated with administration of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it is postulated that hyperthermia induced by anterior coronal LH knife cuts may be due to a disruption of an excitatory projection from the LH to the POA. Since knife cuts of the POA-LH border also produce an increase in BAT temperature !!!REF!!!, it is likely that anterior LH knife-cut-induced hyperthermia is similarly mediated by the effect of prostaglandin on BAT. In this study, we examine the effect of administration of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin on core body temperature increase, resulting from anterior coronal LH knife cuts.  The central serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) neuronal systems are involved in stress-related behaviors such as anxiety !!!REFs!!!, and their impairment is implicated in the pathophysiological mechanism of clinical depression !!!REFs!!!. However, the roles that each monoamine system plays in these behavioral and pathologic conditions remain unknown, yet 5-HT and NA axons innervate similar regions of the brain, including the cerebral cortex !!!REFs!!!. Of interest is the finding that these monoamine axons regenerate in response to brain damage !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, recent investigations have demonstrated that NA axons degenerate or sprout depending on the duration or severity of chronic stress !!!REFs!!!. Despite the considerable number of reports describing stress-related changes in NA axons, little is known about the morphological changes that 5-HT axons undergo following repeated stress. Recently, we have reported the effects of repeated stress on regeneration of 5-HT and NA axons !!!REF!!!. In this study, specific neurotoxins to 5-HT or NA axons were locally injected into the frontal cortex of adult rats to produce partial denervation of these monoamine axons, then mild restraint stress was started 16 days later and continued for 14 consecutive days. Morphological changes in 5-HT and NA axons were visualized by immunohistochemistry. We have found that repeated stress exerts inhibitory influence on the regeneration of 5-HT axons, but not NA axons !!!REF!!!. However, it remains unknown whether repeated stress that began immediately after damage of 5-HT and NA axons could induce changes in the morphology of these monoamine axons. The present study examined the effects of repeated stress on the morphological plasticity of 5-HT and NA axons during early stages of axonal damage. We also investigated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may be a neurotrophic factor for 5-HT neurons !!!REFs!!!, in relation to morphological changes of 5-HT axons following repeated stress.  Pain is a normal consequence of tissue injury. However, in some cases, pain is present outside the injury region and/or persists long after the injury resolves. Pain arising from nerve injury is termed neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain may range from mild and dysesthetic to excruciating and presents a unique problem for pain therapists. Current medications and surgical procedures have limited efficacy and in many cases provide only temporary relief. Improving the treatment of neuropathic pain requires a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological changes following nerve injury. One of the most widely used animal models of neuropathic pain is the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model !!!REF!!!. This model involves loosely tying chromic gut ligatures around the sciatic nerve. Inflammation results from the chromic gut and induces constriction of the sciatic nerve by the loose ligature. This injury produces mechanical allodynia (response to normally non-noxious stimuli) and thermal hyperalgesia (an exaggerated response to normally noxious stimuli). Varying durations of allodynia and hyperalgesia ranging from 4 weeks to 3 months have been reported !!!REF!!!. The varied time course and degree of hyperalgesia might be due to differences in ligature tightness and the resulting extent of sciatic injury !!!REFs!!!. To address these problems, we devised a new model using ameroid constrictors as used by Cornefjord et al. !!!REF!!! in a model of nerve compression due to disc herniations. Because of the simplicity of the surgical procedure and the standardized constriction of the sciatic nerve, we hypothesize that inter- and intra-investigator differences are limited when using ameroid rings and thus observations obtained by different workgroups will be more consistent. A major role for the adjacent saphenous nerve, which is not directly injured in the CCI model, in mediating hyperalgesia and/or allodynia has been hypothesized !!!REFs!!!. Exploitation of the differential anatomy of the dorsal surface of the hindpaw of rodents allows stimulation of sciatic or saphenous afferents discretely. The dorsolateral hindpaw is innervated by branches of the sciatic, while the dorsomedial hindpaw is innervated by the saphenous nerve !!!REFs!!!. We investigated the responses to noxious radiant heat on the dorsomedial, i.e. saphenous innervated and the dorsolateral, i.e. sciatic innervated hindpaw, respectively. Furthermore, Ossipov et al. !!!REF!!! recently found a lack of involvement of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents in tactile allodynia in rats that had a ligation of the L5 and L6 branches of the sciatic nerve (Chung’s model !!!REF!!!). We, therefore, not only examined if ameroid rings are an option for inducing neuropathic pain in rats by gradual constriction of the sciatic nerve, but also investigated the contribution of sciatic and saphenous Aδ and C primary afferents to thermal hyperalgesia using a previously described behavioral model !!!REFs!!!.  The physiological effects of glutamate, the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated by ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Glutamate receptors are believed to exist as oligomers of ionotropic receptor subunits or as dimers of metabotropic receptors. Both receptor types can be divided into several families based on sequence identity and pharmacological, electrophysiological and biochemical characteristics !!!REF!!!. Ionotropic glutamate receptors comprise -methyl-d-asparate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and kainate (KA) receptors !!!REF!!!. Mammals express six NMDA receptor subunits, four AMPA receptor subunits and five KA receptor subunits !!!REF!!!. Oxidative stress and excessive activation of glutamate receptors are converging processes and represent sequential as well as interacting factors that provide a final common pathway for cell vulnerability in the brain !!!REF!!!. While excitotoxic and oxidative injury may occur independently, growing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species formation may also be a specific consequence of glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity !!!REF!!!. The precise cellular mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity under these conditions still remain unclear. Although NMDA receptors likely contribute critically to neuronal injury in various acute conditions, several observations support the hypothesis that AMPA/KA receptors may be of greater importance to the neurodegenerative process !!!REFs!!!. Considerable evidence supports a link between Ca2+ influx and glutamate receptor-mediated neurodegeneration. Brief periods of activation of highly Ca2+-permeable NMDA channels can result in substantial intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and widespread neuronal injury !!!REFs!!!. Mitochondria can buffer these large Ca2+ loads but they do so at the expense of triggering injurious reactive oxygen species (ROS) production !!!REF!!!. Additionally, the extremely rapid interconversion of ROS within the cell can make it difficult to identify the originating species. In contrast to NMDA receptors, AMPA/KA receptors are generally Ca2+ impermeable and trigger injury more slowly, with prolonged periods of activation needed before significant neuronal injury occurs !!!REF!!!. Subpopulations of central neurons, however, are highly vulnerable to AMPA/KA receptor-mediated injury, likely attributable in part to the expression of large numbers of AMPA/KA channels with high Ca2+ permeability !!!REF!!!. Glutamate neurotoxicity is mediated by reactive oxygen species formed as a consequence of several processes, including nitric oxide !!!REFs!!! and superoxide production !!!REF!!!. Superoxide radicals react rapidly with nitric oxide to form highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite, which acts through lipid peroxidation !!!REF!!!. Although there is a number of an intracellular source of free radicals, the mitochondria are thought to be the most important !!!REF!!!. The bioenergetic properties of the in situ mitochondria play a central role in controlling the susceptibility of neurons to acute or chronic neurodegenerative stress. Mitochondria from different tissue sources display differential susceptibility to oxidizing species !!!REFs!!!. However, it is now becoming apparent that, within the brain, there is a differential susceptibility of various brain cell types to oxidizing species. In contrast to astrocytes, neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to the action of free radicals. Such vulnerability may arise from an inability to sustain cellular energy demands by glycolysis and an inferior capacity to handle oxidizing species !!!REF!!!. Regional distribution of NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors of the rat brain was found to be highest in deep layers (layer 5) of the forebrain cortex, cerebellar granule cell layer and caudate putamen !!!REF!!!, which is why we tested these particular brain regions: hippocampus, forebrain cortex, striatum and cerebellum. The Mn-containing superoxide dismutases (SOD) isoenzyme is predominantly localized to neurons and their processes throughout the brain and the spinal cord !!!REF!!!. It seems reasonable to conclude that differences in the basal content of SOD-isoenzymes may contribute to different cellular susceptibilities in neurodegenerative processes that are accompanied by oxidative stress. Mitochondrial MnSOD seams to be a key enzyme in oxygen metabolism in the brain, it is considered to be a major factor in protection of nervous tissue against excitotoxic and ischemic/hypoxic lesion !!!REFs!!!. MnSOD represents a ROS inducible enzyme which should allow the adaptation of brain cells to variation in ROS concentrations resulting from their oxidative metabolism !!!REF!!!. In order to investigate the role of NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors in glutamate neurotoxicity we studied neuroprotective effects of respective receptor antagonists by monitoring the production of superoxide anion and activity of mitochondrial MnSOD in hippocampus, forebrain, cortex, striatum and cerebellum after intrahippocampal injection (KA, non-NMDA receptor agonist, KA plus 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), selective AMPA/KA receptor antagonist, or KA plus 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), selective NMDA receptor antagonist).  Ionotropic -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors are hetero-oligomeric assemblies, composed of NR1, NR2 and sometimes NR3 subunits. The NR2 subunits (A–D) are distributed widely in several structures of the adult brain. NR2B subunit containing NMDA receptor subtypes (NR2B-R) are localized predominantly in the forebrain and in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord !!!REFs!!!. Inflammation and injury of peripheral tissues often result in the development of a chronic pain state characterized by increased sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimulation. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are the consequences of sustained activation of the nociceptive afferent pathways, representing a form of adult neural plasticity. This plasticity is partially based on the activity dependent enhancement of neurotransmission through the NMDA receptors !!!REFs!!!. One phenomenon thought to be involved in the generation of central sensitization underlying hyperalgesia is windup !!!REF!!!. Windup is a short-term increase in the excitability of the neurons during low frequency, high intensity electrical stimulation of the afferent fibres !!!REFs!!!. Although the underlying neuronal processes are not fully understood, and windup is clearly not equivalent to central sensitization per se, it is usually considered as a mechanism leading to amplification of the peripheral nociceptive signals !!!REF!!!, reflecting the intense and persistent barrage of the nociceptive impulses. Indeed, as recently Li et al. !!!REF!!! have shown neuronal events that lead to windup bear the characteristics of central sensitization. Recently, several NR2B subtype selective NMDA receptor antagonists (NR2B-Ant) have become available !!!REFs!!!. These compounds have been studied in different experimental models of nociception !!!REFs!!!. CP-101,606, a highly selective NR2B-Ant !!!REF!!! is effective in both nerve injury- or carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and in tests of capsaicin-induced licking !!!REFs!!!. It is proven to be effective against NMDA and PGE-2 induced allodynia in mice as well !!!REF!!!. CI-1041, another NR2B-Ant !!!REFs!!! is proven to have anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects in rat models of inflammation and neuropathy !!!REFs!!!. The NR2B-Ant Co-101244 is a substance of high efficacy !!!REF!!! in vitro, in patch-clamp experiments. The dorsal root evoked ventral root reflex potential (DR-VRP) can be studied in vitro using the hemisected spinal cord preparation from newborn rats !!!REFs!!!. Reflex potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the L5 dorsal root and recorded from the ipsilateral ventral root consist of two components: a long lasting tonic depolarization (population excitatory post-synaptic potential, EPSP) and a narrow peak, the monosynaptic reflex (MSR), superimposed on the rising phase of EPSP. The former, electrotonic potential involves the activation of NMDA-Rs !!!REFs!!!. However, it is not clear whether NR2B-Rs are implicated in the formation of this potential. A proposed correlate of windup is the cumulative ventral root depolarization (CVRD) in the hemisected spinal cord model that is produced by the temporal summation of DR-VRPs evoked by high-intensity and low-frequency stimulation !!!REF!!!. The pharmacology of CVRD is not very well characterized, the role of peptide !!!REFs!!! and glutamate (both metabotropic and ionotropic) receptors !!!REFs!!! have been demonstrated. It is blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists such as D-APV !!!REFs!!!. This shows that NMDA-Rs play crucial role in generation of windup, therefore in the central hypersensitive states. In order to test the involvement of NR2B-R NMDA antagonists in nociceptive processes in the present paper we used DR-VRPs and the long lasting CVRDs evoked by low frequency–high intensity afferent stimulations in the isolated hemisected juvenile spinal cord preparation !!!REFs!!!. The effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and the NR2B-Ants CP-101,606, CI-1041 and Co-101244 were studied in vitro.  The most effective and most commonly used symptomatic treatment for Parkinson’s disease is still l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) associated with a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa. l-DOPA is then taken up by dopaminergic cell terminals and metabolized to the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine. However, as the disease advances, the therapeutic index (ratio between therapeutic versus secondary effects) of l-DOPA decreases and its antiparkinsonian effect is very often associated with adverse effects, including progressive decline in symptomatic benefit (end-of-dose wearing-off and – phenomena) and dyskinesia. The term dyskinesia implies excessive and abnormal purposeless movements, which interfere with physiological motor activity. l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia used to affect between 60 and 70% of all patients, although now this proportion has decreased to 20–30% due to the awareness of the dose of l-DOPA being a main factor involved in the appearance of dyskinesia. Another main factor is the degree of striatal dopamine denervation, which lowers the threshold at which the dopamine agonist primes for the appearance of dyskinesia. (for recent reviews, see !!!REFs!!!). One important aspect of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is that it is very difficult to treat. Once its appearance is “primed” by some not yet clearly defined striatal mechanism, l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia appears to be persistent or even permanent. The most current view is that abnormal permanent plastic changes in striatal synapses underlie l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, which would represent an abnormal procedural learning process !!!REFs!!!. The rat with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the ascending dopaminergic system (Ungerstedt’ model !!!REF!!!) is considered as a reliable animal model of Parkinson’s disease !!!REFs!!!. The model is, first, a good predictor of drugs with anti-parkinsonian activity (therapeutic effect), which correlates with the ability of the drug to induce rotational behavior contralateral to the lesioned side. Second, the model is also a good predictor of the ability of the drug to induce dyskinesia (secondary effect). Increase in l-DOPA-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIM) and enhancement of dopamine agonist-induced turning behavior in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats offer alternative models to non-human primate models of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Both models reproduce the pharmacological and biochemical changes of non-human primate models of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, both rodent and non-human primate models reproduce the biochemical findings of patients with Parkinson’s disease with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia !!!REFs!!!. Finally, the rat with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the ascending dopaminergic system provides a model for dopaminergic degeneration of Parkinson’s disease. Experimental and clinical data suggest that 6-hydroxydopamine is an endogenous toxic factor involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease !!!REFs!!!. Thus, 6-hydroxydopamine is one of the most common neurotoxins to study nigral degeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the presence of a high density of adenosine A2A receptors in the GABAergic striatopallidal neurons, which play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkison’s disease, and based on the selective antagonistic interactions between A2A receptors with dopamine D2 receptors, we postulated that drugs acting as antagonists of A2A receptors could be used in Parkinson’s disease to increase the effect of remaining endogenous dopamine or to lower the dose of specific D2 receptor agonists required to restore striatopallidal neuronal function !!!REFs!!!. More recently we have been able to demonstrate that, in fact, A2A and D2 receptors establish direct physical interactions, with the formation of A2A–D2 receptor heteromers !!!REF!!!. Results obtained from the application of selective A2A receptor antagonists in different models of Parkinson’s disease strongly support that A2A receptors could be a new target for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (for recent reviews, see !!!REFs!!!). In fact, two recent clinical studies have shown that the A2A receptor antagonist KW-6002 potentiates the therapeutic effect of l-DOPA !!!REFs!!!. In addition to their symptomatic effect in Parkinson’s disease, it has also been suggested that A2A receptor antagonists could provide a protective effect for both the development and expression of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia !!!REFs!!!. When using unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats in studies about therapeutic and secondary effects of potential antiparkinsonian drugs, the animals are used long after the establishment of the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced striatal dopamine denervation. Usually animals are selected according to the turning behavior induced by direct or indirect dopaminergic receptor agonists, a behavior that correlates with the degree of dopamine denervation. Different from most reported studies, in the present work, chronic treatment with l-DOPA and A2A receptor ligands was initiated immediately after the administration of 6-hydroxydopamine. Using this model we wanted to determine, simultaneously, the effects of l-DOPA and A2A receptor ligands on the establishment of the lesion induced by 6-hydroxydopamine and on the development of l-DOPA-induced behavioral sensitization to striatal dopamine receptor stimulation.  Astrocytes are one of the most functionally diverse groups of cells in the nervous system !!!REF!!!. They are key elements for neuronal communication and responsible, amongst other roles, for glutamate uptake in the synaptic cleft and secretion of many neurotrophic factors. Morphology of astrocytes varies depending on regional localization and morphological changes are associated with neuronal activity and injury. Glutamate toxicity has been implicated in neurodegeneration associated with brain ischemia, hypoglycemia and cerebral trauma, conditions related to energy failure, and to elevation of glutamate extracellular levels in brain !!!REF!!!. After development, glucose is the main substrate that fulfills brain energy demands. However, in some circumstances, the nervous system uses the ketone bodies as an energy source. Besides their energetic role, ketone bodies have been shown to act as neuroprotective agents during ischemia !!!REF!!! and against seizure disorders !!!REFs!!!. Some metabolic alterations induced directly by ketone bodies have been described, including increased citrate in astrocytes !!!REF!!!, which could be associated with changes in the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Electrophysiological observations, however, indicate that ketone bodies per se do not reduce neuronal excitability !!!REF!!!. Ketone bodies have been proposed to reduce the plasma levels of IGF-1, a biomarker for astrocytoma progression !!!REF!!!. Interestingly, levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are significantly increased in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and striatum of rats maintained under caloric restriction !!!REF!!!. S100B is a calcium-binding protein, expressed and secreted by astrocytes, which has a role in neuronal survival and excitability !!!REFs!!!. A recent study, in S100B knockout mice, suggests that physiological levels of S100B are involved in the attenuation of epileptogenesis !!!REF!!!. Considering the importance of the glial signalling for neuronal activity we investigated the effect of β-hydroxy-butyrate on S100B secretion in astrocyte cultures from rat cerebral cortex as well as cell morphology and glutamate uptake.  During the aging process there is a progressive loss of sensorial function, which, in the visual system, manifests as the impairment of certain visual abilities. This is attributed, to a great extent, to degenerative alterations in the different components of the visual pathways !!!REFs!!!. These alterations have been reported in the retina, where loss of ganglion cells has been found !!!REFs!!! as well as thinning of the fibre layer of the optic nerve !!!REF!!!. Among the components of the central visual pathways the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) was chosen because it is the main nerve centre between the retina and the cortex. In previous works, we have reported an increase in dLGN volume as well as neuronal hypertrophy !!!REFs!!! and also found degenerative alterations in the relay neurons, which in some cases leads to apoptosis !!!REF!!!. There is evidence connecting the progressive functional deterioration of the CNS due to aging to alterations in brain capillaries. The endothelium of these capillaries is the morphological substrate of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) !!!REFs!!!. The integrity of this barrier is considered crucial for ensuring the proper supply of nutrients to the neurons, as well as their protection against toxins and by-products !!!REFs!!!. The histological changes in brain capillaries most often described are those referring to the thickening of the basal lamina (BL) !!!REF!!!, the thinning and loss of endothelial cells !!!REFs!!!, and gliofibrillar proliferation !!!REF!!!. Other less frequent changes are reported in the mitochondria, pinocytic vesicles, and pericyte coverage, but these vary from one study to another depending on the experimental species used and the CNS area investigated !!!REFs!!!. In order to establish the relationship between CNS capillaries and aging, morphometric methods with optical microscopy were applied to the study of microvascularization in the dLGN, which showed a decrease in volume fraction and capillary diameter !!!REF!!!. Following these results, it was thought that deeper knowledge of the alterations found in capillary wall components would help to establish their causal relationship with neuronal degenerative changes and secondary functional impairment. To this end, ultrastructural quantitative methods were used, which are able to detect changes in BBB component, which would remain undetected by qualitative methods, and also provide data on the functional state of BBB components.  Electrical stimulation of the dorsal column of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) in neurosurgical patients elicits responses such as feelings of fear, terror and impending death, accompanied by marked neurovegetative changes !!!REFs!!!. Such responses have been correlated with the symptoms of a panic attack !!!REFs!!!. In laboratory animals, electrical or chemical stimulation of this structure elicits defensive reactions such as flight and/or fight, accompanied by cardiovascular and neurovegetative changes (for a review, see !!!REFs!!!). In view of such similarities, studies have been done using the aversion induced by electrical/chemical stimulation of DPAG in laboratory animals as an experimental model for panic !!!REFs!!!. Employing this model, Schütz et al. !!!REF!!! verified that intra-DPAG injection of serotonin (5-HT) and of the non-selective agonist of serotonergic receptors 5-methoxy-,-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) raised the threshold of DPAG electrical stimulation for inducing escape behavior. Moreover, these researchers observed that the inhibitory effect of 5-HT agonists on escape was blocked by local pre-treatment with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin, implicating this subtype of serotonin receptors in the regulation of this defensive behavior. Later on, various studies demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptors within the DPAG also participate in the regulation of escape response induced by DPAG aversive stimulation !!!REFs!!!. In one of these investigations it was shown that intra-DPAG administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and BAY-R-1532 as well as of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI decreased the aversion generated by electrical stimulation of the same structure !!!REF!!!. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT and BAY-R-1532 were blocked by intra-DPAG pre-treatment with the preferential 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190. On the other hand, the effect of DOI was blocked by the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist spiperone. Based on these results, the authors suggested a similar participation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the regulation of escape response elicited by electrical stimulation of the DPAG. In the same study !!!REF!!!, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT was also blocked by spiperone, and the effect of DOI was blocked by NAN-190. This result was interpreted by the authors in terms of a functional interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the regulation of escape. More recently, the elevated T-maze !!!REFs!!! has also been used for studying the involvement of serotonergic receptors of the DPAG in the regulation of escape behavior !!!REF!!!. This test has the advantage of evoking escape by means of an ethologically-relevant threatening stimulus, not relying on the invasive procedures implicated in intracerebral stimulation methods. Besides the escape response, the elevated T-maze allows the study of inhibitory avoidance behavior. Based on the pharmacological validation of this model, the escape response in this test has also been correlated with panic disorder, while inhibitory avoidance has been correlated with generalized anxiety disorder !!!REFs!!!. Performing experiments in the elevated T-maze, Zanoveli et al. !!!REF!!! observed that intra-DPAG administration of serotonin facilitated the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance and inhibited the escape response. In contrast, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT inhibited both inhibitory avoidance and escape responses. Moreover, the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI had no effect on inhibitory avoidance, although it reduced the escape response. Thus, all the agonists employed inhibited the escape response, a panicolytic-like effect, but induced different changes in the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance. Based on these results, Zanoveli et al. !!!REF!!! suggested that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors of the DPAG are also involved in the modulation of escape behavior in the elevated T-maze. In addition, the authors suggested the participation of the DPAG serotonergic system in the modulation of behaviors related to generalized anxiety disorder, such as inhibitory avoidance. More specifically, Zanoveli et al. !!!REF!!! suggested that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in the DPAG may play an opposite role in the modulation of these behaviors. The aim of the present study was to extend the investigation about the involvement of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors of the DPAG in the regulation of the defensive responses generated by the elevated T-maze. To this end, in experiment 1 we verified the effects of intra-DPAG administration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin and of the preferential 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SDZ SER 082. In experiment 2, we evaluated the effects of the same antagonists when microinjected before the intra-DPAG administration of the endogenous agonist serotonin. In experiment 3, WAY-100635 or ketanserin was administered before the agonist 8-OH-DPAT in order to determine whether there is a functional interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors of the DPAG in the control of escape, as suggested by Nogueira and Graeff !!!REF!!!. For the same reason, in experiment 4, the same antagonists were microinjected before the agonist DOI. After the tests in the elevated T-maze, the animals were submitted to the open field test to assess possible drug effects on locomotor activity.  HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is present in approximately 20% of AIDS patients late in the course of HIV-infection !!!REF!!!. Central to its pathologic mechanism is the prolonged activation of brain mononuclear phagocytes, called microglia !!!REF!!!. They provide structural and functional support to neurons as well as serving as the primary source of productive infection by HIV-1 in the central nervous system !!!REF!!!. Postmortem studies have suggested the brain is a viral reservoir in both demented and non-demented HIV patients and that only those individuals with immune activation in the brain will likely develop HAD !!!REF!!!. Early in HIV infection, the infected monocyte-derived cells infiltrate the brain and HIV is observed to gain access to T-cells, microglia, and other cells primarily through the interaction of gp120 binding to CD4 and the CCR5. The risk, however, of developing HAD increases late in HIV infection, as the CD4 cell count reaches 200 and below !!!REF!!!. At this time the HIV typically displays greater usage of the CXCR4 coreceptors rather than CCR5. A CD4 cell count, which has declined to approximately 200, is believed to also allow or facilitate autonomous brain infection by HIV. Brain inflammation then becomes a self-potentiating cycle once the initial CD4 nadir is reached and immune mediators are released. For example under the influence of IFN-γ, expression of CD40 is dose-dependently enhanced by as much as 20-fold !!!REFs!!!; greatly enhancing the ability of brain microglia to become activated. Additionally the HIV-1 proteins, such as gp120, have been shown in vivo to be toxic to neurons via independent, direct activation of microglia !!!REF!!!. Nicotine binding at microglial or neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) has shown anti-inflammatory properties. Nicotine and acetylcholine pretreatment inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α release in murine derived microglia !!!REF!!!. In nicotine precultured neurons, binding at the α7 nAChR provides neuroprotection from the excitatory amino acid (EAA) glutamate as well as other inflammatory factors !!!REF!!!. Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand (APL) of nAChRs !!!REFs!!! and cholinesterase inhibitor !!!REF!!!. Galantamine up-regulates agonist responses of nAChR receptors at concentrations between 0.1 and 1μM while concentrations greater than 10μM result in nAChR inhibition. In vivo studies have shown that galantamine, acting as an APL on presynaptic and tonically active nAChRs, potentiates glutameric or GABAergic transmission whereas the non-APL cholinesterase inhibitors lack this therapeutic effect on synaptic transmission !!!REF!!!. While many studies have used live HIV-1 to produce microglial activation, here we sought to investigate a novel in vitro model simulating HAD-like microglial activation after introduction of HIV-1gp120, and IFN-γ. Using this model we then examined the anti-inflammatory mechanism of galantamine, and nicotine.  The central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) in the rat was recognized as a relatively well-defined area lying medially to the stria terminalis and previously was divided into two parts, the medial and lateral subdivisions !!!REF!!!. Subsequent detailed cytoarchitectural and immunohistochemical studies revealed an additional capsular subfield on the lateral aspect of the nucleus !!!REFs!!!. These three prominent subdivisions are specifically linked to the pattern of projection linking the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) to the CEA. It is generally accepted that the ventrolateral portion including the external lateral subnucleus of the PBN gives rise to major projections to the lateral of CEA (LCE). The medial portion of the PBN projects primarily to the medial of CEA (MCE), while the lateral portion including the ventral lateral and central lateral subnuclei of the PBN projects to the lateral capsular of CEA (LCCE) !!!REF!!!. The CEA is known to exert a strong influence on autonomic and behavioral aspects of cardiovascular functions !!!REFs!!!. In recent studies based on the method of immunohistochemical labeling of Fos, the population of neurons activated by a change of blood pressure was reported to be located in various areas of the brainstem and forebrain. In particular, in response to hypotension Fos-immunoreactive (IR) neurons are mostly located in the LCE and parabrachial region, as well as in the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) and rostral ventrolateral medulla !!!REFs!!!. With respect to the neural connections of the amygdala with the brainstem, it has been repeatedly pointed out that the LCE is strongly interconnected with the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) !!!REFs!!!. In contrast to such connectivity of the LCE, projections of the MCE are widely distributed in the brainstem, including the parasympathetic preganglionic nuclei and the NTS !!!REFs!!!. The CEA is also a relay for a large number of peptidergic and catecholaminergic pathways which, in turn, are differentially distributed within the subdivisions of the nucleus. The LCE is characterized by containing abundant vasoactive intestinal polypeptide fibers !!!REFs!!! while noradrenergic and neuropeptide-Y-containing axons are concentrated in the MCE !!!REFs!!!. By further immunohistochemical analysis, Schwaber et al. !!!REF!!! described that fibers containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) fibers and originating from the PBN are also preferentially distributed to the LCE, and this parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway might be highly significant for the central cardiovascular control. In fact, previous studies revealed that the CGRP-IR neurons in the CNS have a neuroregulatory action on arterial blood pressure !!!REFs!!!. Although the studies mentioned above raise the possibility that the parabrachio-LCE fibers are involved in cardiovascular control and activated by a sustained decrease in blood pressure, up to date no structural correlates of such functional implications are available. Therefore, the present study was performed to establish in the rat, at the light and electron microscopic levels, whether the parabrachial inputs are anatomically linked to the Fos-IR neurons in the LCE in response to hypotension induced by intravenous administration of hydralazine-hydrochloride (HDZ-HCl).  In hibernating rodents the annual cycle of reproductive function is under the control of the photoperiod !!!REFs!!!. This control involves the pineal gland !!!REF!!!, in which the duration of the dark phase is transduced by shortening or lengthening the nocturnal synthesis and release of melatonin !!!REFs!!!. Several studies have shown that pinealectomy prevents the testicular regression normally induced by short photoperiod (SP) in “long day” species !!!REFs!!!, whereas in some “short day” species pinealectomy leads to total cessation of testis function !!!REFs!!!. In golden hamsters, prolonging the presence of melatonin by daily injection or programmed perfusion of the hormone in animals kept under long photoperiod (LP), or in pinealectomized animals, leads to testicular atrophy !!!REFs!!!. On the contrary, gonadal development is observed under these conditions in the mink !!!REFs!!!, a short day breeder. The jerboa, a desert hibernating rodent, is a long day species. In the jerboa, the duration of melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland is longer in autumn–winter, corresponding to the period of sexual quiescence, than during the period of sexual activity in spring–early summer !!!REF!!!. Therefore, in the jerboa the synchronization of the annual sexual cycle with season by the photoperiod seems to involve the pineal gland and melatonin. In short day species, the photoperiod modulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) activity via melatonin, principally in the mediobasal hypothalamus !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, this modulatory effect is still largely not understood in long day breeders, and especially in rodents !!!REFs!!!. In the jerboa, the SP-induced decrease in testis weight and in the concentration of circulating testosterone !!!REF!!! occurs in parallel with a decrease in the concentration of GnRH (unpublished data). Inversely, LP maintains testis activation !!!REF!!!, with an increase in plasma gonadotropin levels (unpublished data). It has been reported that in the jerboa the seasonal variation of hypothalamic GnRH levels does not involve the photoperiod as a synchronizer !!!REF!!!. On this basis, the aim of the present work was to determine the role of the pineal gland and melatonin in the photoperiodic control of the annual sexual cycle in the male jerboa, and to identify changes in the hypothalamic GnRH-containing neuronal cell populations involved in these regulatory mechanisms.  Cholinergic neurotransmission in the CNS modulates hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity, stimulating secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) from the hypothalamus, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary, and corticosteroids from the adrenal glands !!!REFs!!!. Cholinergic regulation is mediated by both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the brainstem !!!REFs!!!. Functional sex differences (sexual diergism) characterize the brain areas regulating HPA axis activity !!!REF!!!. For example, basal plasma AVP concentrations are higher in male than in female rats !!!REF!!!, and higher in men than in women !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, basal and stress-related ACTH and corticosterone (CORT) concentrations are typically higher in female rats !!!REF!!!. Our previous animal and human studies have demonstrated that HPA hormone responses to cholinergic drugs also are sexually diergic !!!REFs!!!. These male–female differences likely result from differential influences of gonadal steroids on the HPA axis, particularly in females. HPA and hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis function are closely related: basal HPA activity changes as the estrous cycle fluctuates !!!REFs!!!; abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis results in abnormal HPA axis regulation !!!REF!!!; interference with the adrenal corticosteroid circadian rhythm results in irregular estrous cycles !!!REF!!!; and stress, which stimulates the HPA axis, has an inhibitory effect on reproductive function !!!REF!!!. Basal HPA activity is highest when estradiol and progesterone concentrations peak – at the end of the follicular phase or beginning of the luteal phase in humans !!!REFs!!!, and during proestrous in rats !!!REFs!!!. As well, we have found that HPA responses to cholinergic stimulation by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (PHYSO), are greater during proestrous and estrous !!!REF!!!. We previously demonstrated that HPA responses to nicotine (NIC) are sexually diergic !!!REF!!!: Male rats had a significantly greater, dose-related AVP response to NIC than did females. In contrast, female rats had significantly greater, dose-related ACTH and CORT responses to NIC than did males. These sex differences were most evident following NIC (0.3mg/kg). At a higher NIC dose (0.5mg/kg), female and male HPA responses were not different. In that study, however, hormone responses were not analyzed by estrous cycle stage, due to insufficient sample sizes. Because of potential variability in female responses to NIC across the estrous cycle, it is important to determine female responses at each stage of the cycle, in order to have complete data for comparison with male responses. The present study, therefore, further explored sexually diergic HPA axis responses to cholinergic stimulation by NIC, by determining the effects of two doses of NIC (0.3 and 0.5mg/kg) on plasma AVP, ACTH, and CORT concentrations in female rats during all estrous cycle stages, as well as in male rats.  Glutamate receptors, especially the NMDA-type, play a crucial role in use-dependent modification of cortical synaptic connections during development or regeneration after nerve injuries !!!REFs!!!. Plastic changes in the developing nervous system are related to changes in the number and/or subunit composition of NMDA receptors. Alterations in the duration of NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents also correlate with changes in synaptic plasticity !!!REFs!!!, the shorter is the response, the smaller is the plastic change. Activated NMDA receptors allow to pass through the plasma membrane large amounts of Ca2+-ion, thus several enzymatic reactions regulated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ depend on the activity of NMDA receptors !!!REF!!!. Local changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level strongly influence the operation of the synapses !!!REF!!!. In cortical neuronal networks rhythmic inhibitory and excitatory effects underlie the normal function. Fast synaptic excitatory transmission is controlled by local inhibitory connections. However, destroyed connections or altered inputs can cause imbalance in cortical activity, frequently by shifting the activity towards excitation !!!REF!!!. Normally, topographic connections in the sensory system are stable in adulthood, synaptic dialogue depends on the proper synaptic structures !!!REF!!!. However, following nerve injuries, active structural changes are necessary to take place during the regeneration of cortical functions. This means changes in receptor-sensitivity, receptor field size and rearrangement of fine synaptic structures !!!REF!!!, during which cells are supposed to return to a more inducible state similar to the developmental stage. Excitatory amino acid receptors are highly involved in the regenerative changes by activating Ca2+-sensitive cytoplasmic mechanisms, which play a role in the rearrangement of postsynaptic cytoskeletal density or receptor structure !!!REFs!!!. In addition to Ca2+-sensitive phosphorylating processes, some Ca2+-dependent proteolytic enzymes, such as calpains, also contribute to the modification of synaptic functions during regeneration after brain injury !!!REF!!!. The well-structured somatosensory system of rats, especially the vibrissae-barrel cortex pathway offers a good model for studying developmental processes and regenerative mechanisms. It has been shown that recovery following peripheral nerve injury in the somatosensory cortex depends on glutamate receptor activity !!!REF!!!. Altered AMPA receptor activity and increased cellular excitability were also detected in previous experiments !!!REF!!!, but the ability of plastic synaptic changes has not been analysed in detail. The aim of the present study was to characterise the mechanisms of changes underlying altered synaptic efficacy of the barrel cortex for a relatively long period after infraorbital nerve transection. In the in vitro slice experiments, the changes in excitability in the supragranular layer of the somatosensory cortex were studied following input deprivation. Changes of duration, amplitude and pharmacological sensitivity of responses evoked by electrical stimulation in the supragranular layer of the barrel cortex were studied. Modulation of synaptic efficacy was also analysed. Beside in vitro electrophysiological studies, open-field behavioural experiments were run to detect possible changes associated with cortical oversensitization.  Diabetes mellitus becomes clinically apparent only after several years of disease, which is associated with functional and structural abnormalities of eyes, kidneys, nerves and arteries !!!REFs!!!. Diabetes mellitus have been reported to be accompanied by a number of behavioral and hormonal abnormalities, including hyperphagia, reduced motor activity !!!REFs!!! and decreased serum levels of growth hormone !!!REF!!!, luteinizing hormone !!!REF!!! and thyroid stimulating hormone !!!REF!!!. CNS abnormalities including neuronal atrophy and axonal degenerations !!!REFs!!! are also associated with diabetes. The altered levels of neurotransmitter in specific brain areas in patients with diabetes mellitus !!!REFs!!! and in animals with experimental diabetes !!!REFs!!! have been documented. There are, however several reports on animals suggesting that not only a turn over rate, but also a steady state level of monoamines may be altered in diabetes. Previous studies have reported that diabetic animals showed significant changes in monoamines in few specific areas of the brain !!!REFs!!!. Our previous study have also shown that monoamines, in alloxan-diabetic !!!REFs!!! as well as in glucose-induced hyperglycemic and NH4Cl-induced acidotic !!!REF!!! rats was altered in specific areas of brain, these changes were reversed after insulin administration. In this study, the first part of our investigation was attempted to study the level of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in various brain regions after alloxan diabetes and diabetic rats treated with insulin. The next part of our study was focused on the expression of PKC-α in discrete brain areas to identify the role of PKC in the regulation of indoleamines, since several studies showed that phorbol esters, a predominant PKC-α activator, increased the neurotransmitter release !!!REFs!!!. The PKC family consists of several isoforms, under three major divisions such as classical, novel and atypical. The Classical Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are sensitive to Ca2+, diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters, plays major role in the regulation of the neurotransmitter synthesis and release !!!REFs!!!. The major aim of this study was to delineate the role of PKC on the regulation of indoleamines in alloxan diabetic and insulin-treated-diabetic conditions.  Long-term ethanol consumption causes significant changes in brain structures and neurotransmitters !!!REFs!!! Neuronal cell deaths and neurotoxicity due to the effects of ethanol exposure account for some of these changes !!!REFs!!!. Ethanol withdrawal syndrome (EWS) occurs after a sudden cessation of chronic ethanol consumption. EWS consists of symptoms such as anxiety, tremor, hyperexcitability and convulsions in rats !!!REF!!!. EWS is also an evidence for the development of physical dependence to ethanol, in both humans !!!REF!!! and animals !!!REFs!!!. There are some evidences indicating that EWS may be a result of neuroadaptive transformations relevant to chronic ethanol consumption !!!REFs!!!. The mechanisms underlying the adaptive neuropathology observed in EWS are not exactly known. However, Nestby et al. !!!REF!!! showed that free-choice ethanol consumption in rats increased dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission for a long time in the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen. The degree of these long-term neuroadaptations was associated with the daily ethanol consumption !!!REF!!!. Also development of tolerance !!!REF!!! and cognitive impairment with cholinergic degeneration !!!REFs!!! seen in experimental animals chronically exposed to ethanol, support the neuroadaptation hypothesis. These neuroadaptive changes observed in cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways originate from hippocampus and forebrain !!!REF!!!. Decreases both in acetylcholine (ACh) level and acetylcholine transferase (AChT) activity have been reported in hippocampus and cortex of ethanol-dependent rats during EWS !!!REFs!!!. Some evidences indicated that cholinergic system might play a role in EWS !!!REFs!!!. In a previous study, Imperato et al. !!!REF!!! suggested that ACh release in the hippocampus of rats decreased during the first 4 days of chronic ethanol consumption. On the other hand, cessation of ethanol administration at the 7th day produced a marked increase in the rat hippocampus, which is significant between the 6th and 72nd hours of EWS !!!REF!!!. However, the role of ACh release in the development of ethanol dependence and EWS have not been investigated yet. -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, when activated by glutamic acid, the most extensive excitatory neurotransmitter in CNS !!!REFs!!! stimulates Ca2+ influx into neurons, and the increased Ca2+ conductance in turn mediates seizure activity !!!REF!!!. Ethanol that is given acutely acts as a potent inhibitor of NMDA receptors in central nervous system (CNS) !!!REFs!!!. However, chronic ethanol consumption causes an increase in glutamate and NMDA receptor density in the brain !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, Moor et al. !!!REF!!! showed that NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists could increase ACh release in hippocampus. On the other hand, acute ethanol administration inhibits neuronal calcium channels !!!REF!!!, while it increases the density of voltage dependent calcium channels by chronic administration in clonal neural cells !!!REFs!!!. There are also some evidences that calcium channel antagonists can inhibit some symptoms of EWS !!!REFs!!!. Ethanol induced increase in the sensivity of NMDA receptors and calcium channels may contribute to the hyperexcitability observed in EWS !!!REFs!!!. It was also shown that NMDA antagonists prevent neuronal toxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal in neuronal cultures !!!REFs!!!. Studies on the development of physical dependence to ethanol and EWS have been focused on NMDA receptors !!!REF!!! and voltage gated Ca2+ channels !!!REFs!!!. However, ethanol also affects the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway, which spreads to the pyramidal cells of hippocampus !!!REF!!!. Hippocampal pyramidal cells receive afferents from glutamatergic pathways in addition to cholinergic pathways !!!REF!!!. Nevertheless, the effects of NMDA receptors and Ca2+ channels on cholinergic system are not clear yet. Investigating the effects of NMDA receptor and neuronal Ca2+ channel antagonists on hippocampal ACh release in the induction of seizures seen in EWS and PTZ-kindling may be valuable in explaining the mechanism and treatment of them. In the present study, effects of NMDA receptor and neuronal Ca2+ channel antagonists on extracellular ACh and choline (Ch) release in the hippocampus of ethanol-withdrawn (EW) rats were investigated by in vivo microdialysis.  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, degenerative disease that shows a fast progression rate in the early phase of PD and that slows in the later phase of the disease. This observation is based on the followed clinical scores of the parkinsonian symptoms !!!REF!!! and 18F-dopa uptake in the putamen !!!REF!!!. It is supposed that two drugs, namely selegiline !!!REFs!!! and ropirinole !!!REFs!!!, have favorable influence on the development of PD. Although selegiline adding to levodopa decreased the decline in motor performance and freezing of gait, but induced more dyskinesias during the 2-year follow-up !!!REF!!!. Patients with ropirinole intake showed decreased decline in dopamine uptake assessed by 18F-dopa than that with levodopa, although their motor control was worse and the side effects appeared more frequently in the group with ropirinole !!!REF!!!. The dopamine uptake did not correlate with the change in clinical symptoms. The applied drugs in the treatment of PD have negligible influence on the development of the disease. It was published that microelektroshock induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) decreased the reaction time in PD !!!REF!!!, increased the speed of active movement !!!REF!!! and improved the parkinsonian symptoms !!!REFs!!!. Opposite to the low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the high frequency of it destroyed the spiral drawing !!!REF!!! and the repetitive stimulation under the finger tapping did not change the reaction time !!!REF!!!. The favorable effect of low frequency rTMS lasted a few months and it needed to be repeated to keep a balanced moving state on a day long. It is supposed according to the short-term studies with low frequency stimulation of rTMS that it has no side effect, but the unwanted effects of long-term, regularly repeated stimulation are not known; further, the effect of rTMS on the progression of PD has not been detected yet. The aim of our more than 3-year follow-up retrospective study was to compare two groups of patients with PD. Between them, the main difference was the applied 1Hz rTMS therapy for 7 days. In the group A, 29 patients (age: group A, 66.3 ± 8.2 years; duration of disease, 4.1 ± 3.3 years) with PD were recruited. They visited the outpatient clinic from 1986 to 1995. Every patient, who was followed for at least 3 years, was involved in this retrospective study. Parkinsonian symptoms were assessed by Graded Rating Scale !!!REF!!! which mainly focuses on the parameters of waking, rigidity and fast alternating movement on both the upper and lower extremities. Patients with PD were tested monthly. From 1996 to 2001, the rTMS was introduced in the treatment of patients with PD in another town. Forty-six patients with PD were recruited into the group B (age: 63.9 ± 9.0 years, duration of the disease: 4.5 ± 3.0 years). Group B was given the same drugs as the group A (10mg selegiline, Jumex; Sanofi-Synthelabo, standard levodopa + benzerazid Madopar 250mg; Hoffmann La Roche and slow-release levodopa wirh carbidopa given as Sinemet CR 250 MSD). These patients were selected because they had received at least two 1-week session of treatment with rTMS each year (using an average of 2.42 ± 0.11). Parkinsonian symptoms were detected before and after the treatment for 7 days and 1 month after rTMS then every 3 months. Those were assessed by Graded Rating Scale and Unified Parkinsonian Disability Scale (UPDRS). The two scores correlated well with each other ( = 0.8). Patients gave their informed consent and the local Ethical Committee gave permission for the study to proceed. Repetitive TMS was given twice a day for 7 days. Each session involved 50 stimulus applied 1Hz and an intensity of 25% of the maximal output of the device (2.3T). The equipment used was a Dantec Maglite transcranial magnetic stimulator with a 14cm diameter coil. The coil was positioned over vertex of the skull. The association between initial score, rTMS treatment and rate of change in score was assessed by repeated measures regression models with random effects error structures (linear mixed model). The fixed effects part of the model included estimates of the mean overall level of score at the baseline and the mean rate of decline per day during the follow-up and the interaction between the rate of decline and the treatment. The random part of the model is assumed that each person's individual path then followed the mean path, except for random effects, which modified the overall level to be higher or lower, and the rate of change to be faster or slower depending from the subject initial score. The model was validated graphically for assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity. A similar model was applied in Wilson's study !!!REF!!!. Other characteristics of the two groups were compared by mean values using Wilcoxon's rank sum test and unpaired -tests, as appropriate. All statistical calculations were performed using commercially available statistical software (Splus v. 6.1, Insightful, Seattle, WA).  In the developing brain, acetylcholine is a neurotrophic agent that plays a promotional role in cholinergic target cell proliferation and differentiation, and ultimately in architectural modeling of brain regions receiving cholinergic projections !!!REFs!!!. Depending on the maturational stage, activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) enhances cell proliferation of some neural precursors !!!REF!!! while inhibiting proliferation or evoking apoptosis in other neural cells !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, excessive nAChR stimulation, delivered with inappropriate timing, underlies the neuroteratogenicity of nicotine, contributing to the abnormalities of cell replication and differentiation, axonogenesis and synaptogenesis, and synaptic function and behavior that underlie the adverse effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy !!!REFs!!!. At the same time, nicotine shows neuroprotectant properties, preventing apoptosis evoked by cytotoxic drugs or hypoxia !!!REFs!!!. Through its ability to stimulate the release of neurotrophins, nicotine may supply the protectant effect of tobacco use in Parkinson's disease !!!REFs!!!. The α4β2 nAChR subtype is the most abundant form in the mammalian brain !!!REFs!!! and its upregulation by nicotine in the fetus is mechanistically involved in the adverse effects of nicotine on cell development, as well as providing a biomarker for neural cell stimulation by nicotine !!!REFs!!!. Although α7 nAChRs are present in much lower concentrations than the α4β2 subtype, they are closely involved in neuritic outgrowth !!!REFs!!!, neurotoxicity and neuroprotection !!!REFs!!!, and are themselves modulated by toxicant injury !!!REFs!!!; expression of this subtype is higher during development in a wide variety of brain regions !!!REFs!!!. Accordingly, untangling the specific role of α7 nAChRs in neurodevelopment, and the targeting of this receptor by neurotoxicants, represents a particularly complicated problem. The current study takes several different approaches to identifying the regulation and roles of α7 nAChRs in the developing brain. First, we evaluated the effects of a brief period of nicotine treatment in the neonatal rat, encompassing brain regions with differing proportions of neural projections and cell bodies (brainstem, forebrain, cerebellum), and bracketing defined stages: postnatal days (PN) 1–4 for peaks of neurogenesis and differentiation, and PN11–14 and 21–24 for axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. We then compared these effects with those seen after gestational nicotine treatment in a model that simulates nicotine levels associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy !!!REFs!!!. Finally, we contrasted the effects of nicotine with those of chlorpyrifos, a commonly used organophosphate insecticide that enhances cholinergic function by inhibiting cholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine !!!REF!!!. The neurotoxicant effects of chlorpyrifos undergo a distinct shift during neonatal development, exhibiting primarily noncholinergic mechanisms in fetal or early neonatal stages, and emergence of cholinergic components during axonogenesis and synaptogenesis in the second postnatal week !!!REFs!!!; the effects of chlorpyrifos should thus show homologous actions to those of nicotine during the phase in which it elicits cholinergic stimulation.  Seizure is a brain malfunction that has been continuously under investigation in terms of diagnosis and pharmacological management. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, the magnitude of neural cells injury and the consequences to neural network caused by seizures are not fully understood. In this context, there is evidence for a role of excitatory amino acids, mainly glutamate, in the neurotoxic effects of seizures !!!REFs!!!. In experimental seizures involving other neurotransmitter systems, the GABA-A receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) has been classically used !!!REFs!!!. S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) are considered sensitive markers of brain damage since their levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or blood in acute and chronic central nervous system (CNS) injuries !!!REFs!!!. S100B is a calcium binding protein physiologically produced and released by astrocytes, whereas NSE is a glycolytic pathway enzyme, being the γγ isoform predominantly neuronal !!!REFs!!!. The cellular specificity of these proteins can be used to understand the involvement of different brain cell types in pathological conditions. Increase of NSE levels indicates neuronal damage, whereas increase in S100B may reflect either glial damage or astrocytic reactions to neural injury (reactive astrogliosis), which may have neuroprotective properties !!!REFs!!!. The purinergic system has important roles in the modulation of CNS activity through activation of specific purinergic receptors !!!REF!!!. The adenine- and guanine-based purines exert significant extracellular roles as can be evidenced by ATP (via P2 receptors), which acts as a neurotransmitter, and the nucleosides adenosine (via P1 receptors) and guanosine (unknown receptors) that are neuromodulators of the glutamatergic system. In particular, adenosine levels increases in the synaptic cleft during seizures, being recognized as an endogenous anticonvulsant compound !!!REF!!!. Guanosine is another purine nucleoside that has only recently been shown to exert anticonvulsant properties and to increase glial glutamate uptake !!!REFs!!!. The concentration of extracellular purines (nucleotides and nucleosides) is regulated by neural cell release/uptake and by ecto- and soluble nucleotidases activities, which include the triphosphate diphosphohydrolase family termed NTPDase. These enzymes, in association with ecto-5′-nucleotidase, perform the sequential hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides down to nucleosides !!!REF!!!. Increased NTPDase activities have been detected in synaptosomes and serum of rats submitted to seizures !!!REFs!!!, possibly comprising a neuroprotective response against brain injury. We have previously described the presence of soluble NTPDase activities in rat CSF, suggesting that they could fulfill a regulatory role or serve as putative markers of brain injury !!!REF!!!. The aim of this study was to evaluate astrocyte and/or neuronal injury in rats induced to a PTZ model of acute seizures by measuring S100B and NSE CSF levels. Additionally, we determined ADP and GDP hydrolysis by soluble NTPDases in the CSF, as well as the concentration of the nucleosides adenosine, inosine and guanosine, as putative markers of brain injury.  Although there have been some reports on the levels of circulating hormones in male rats, the existence of a circadian rhythm is still controversial, and there is, particularly, a lack of data associated with sexual performance. The description of male copulatory performance displaying diurnal rhythmicity !!!REF!!! suggests that this behavior may be modulated by a circadian rhythm. As mentioned earlier, there were no simultaneous measurements of hormone levels in these studies. Hormonal daily variation in male rats showed an evening decrease in testosterone levels while those of progesterone were lower in the morning and gradually increased during the day !!!REF!!!. Although diurnal variations have been described in adult rats, there is no consensus as to peaks and nadirs in hormone levels during the 24h period !!!REFs!!!. This variation has been related to several factors such as age, strain differences, methods, period of exposure to light, time of blood sampling and seasonal variations !!!REFs!!!. The discrepancies become increasingly evident whenever additional factors such as surgery (castration, adrenalectomy) or any other stressing event is present. Sleep loss is associated with several behavioral responses !!!REFs!!! some of which are under hormonal control including sexual behavior. In this respect we recently reported data showing that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) elicited genital reflexes (penile erection – PE, and ejaculation – EJ) in male rats. These behaviors were potentiated by a single injection of cocaine !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the study of genital reflexes induced by PSD rats in the absence of receptive females seems to be a good model to assess sexual performance and PE response to different drugs !!!REFs!!!. Genital reflexes are also used to evaluate sexual physiological arousal throughout the rat's life span !!!REFs!!!. Neuroendocrine research on the diurnal variation is of fundamental importance in view of our limited understanding of the link between secretory patterns and the neural-hormonal control of genital reflexes. Thus, the present study was aimed at investigating sexual and hormonal aspects of the effect of diurnal variation in PSD male rats.  Constant-current (DC) galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) delivered by large surface area electrodes placed over the surface of skin behind the ears is known to induce eye-movement responses in humans (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Eye movements were observed to consist of tonic and phasic components, and were predominantly torsional and horizontal in direction with smaller vertical deviations. It was presumed that these eye movements were caused by an activation of primary vestibular afferents !!!REF!!!. Behavioural studies with GVS have been interpreted as showing the pattern of eye movements observed involves combined stimulation of primary vestibular afferents supplying the horizontal semicircular canals (SCC) and otoliths !!!REF!!!. In order to verify whether this is the case, we have recorded eye movements and responses from single primary vestibular neurons in guinea pigs during GVS. Galvanic vestibular stimulation conducted in guinea pigs found that 80μA constant-current GVS delivered through chronically implanted electrodes positioned on the tensor-tympani muscles of the middle ear induced predominantly vertical and horizontal eye movements !!!REF!!!. This is apparently inconsistent with results from humans and other species, but that inconsistency is resolved because vertical displacement of the eye in lateral-eyed guinea pigs involves activation of similar extra-ocular muscles as torsional displacement of the eye in frontal-eyed humans !!!REF!!!. Each orthogonal pair of eye muscles was shown to predominantly receive primary vestibular input from vestibular organs having similar geometric orientations !!!REF!!!. Hence, GVS-induced vertical eye deviation in guinea pigs and GVS-induced torsional eye deviation in humans are likely to reflect similar physiological patterns of primary vestibular afferent activity. Cathodal galvanic stimulation increases the activity of primary vestibular afferent neurons, whereas anodal galvanic stimulation decreases the activity of these neurons !!!REF!!!. The normalised sensitivity of these unitary responses (!!!MATH!!!) was shown to depend on discharge regularity !!!REFs!!!, where irregularly discharging afferents (CV* > 0.1) were more sensitive to galvanic stimulation than regularly discharging afferents (CV* < 0.1). These previous studies determined the sensitivity of afferents in terms of the change in firing rate (spikes/s) induced by a brief, single constant-current pulse of galvanic stimulation. However, a more reliable measure of galvanic sensitivity was sought in the present study by determining the gain (spikes/s/μA) of primary vestibular afferents over multiple constant-current galvanic pulses of differing amplitudes, and deriving a gain value from the line best fitting all these responses. Interestingly, in a previous study the firing of more irregularly discharging afferents was silenced during delivery of moderate intensities (up to 100μA) of anodal galvanic stimulation through perilymphatic electrodes !!!REFs!!!. In one study !!!REF!!! it was shown that in one irregularly discharging afferent the firing rate increase during cathodal stimulation was greater than the firing rate decrease during the same intensity of anodal stimulation. In comparison, a regularly discharging afferent was shown to respond symmetrically to each polarity of galvanic stimulation. However, no indication of how reliable or widespread this excitatory bias is across neurons and across animals has been provided, and we further sought to obtain such an indication. Although primary vestibular afferent responses to galvanic stimulation have been examined in some mammals, including squirrel monkeys !!!REFs!!! and chinchillas !!!REF!!!, responses to GVS have not been characterised previously in guinea pigs. The previous studies have provided evidence to suggest that primary vestibular afferents innervating individual vestibular sensory regions respond to galvanic stimulation. However, a direct comparison of the gains of primary vestibular afferents across different vestibular end organs has not been reliably performed. The present study characterised the sensitivity (or gain) of primary vestibular afferents for constant-current galvanic stimulation applied externally to the inner ear in guinea pigs. External GVS was delivered in the form of surface galvanic stimulation applied over the skin covering the mastoids or through electrodes implanted in the tensor-tympani muscle of the middle ear. The location of the stimulating electrode in the tensor tympani was chosen for three reasons. First, it was a conveniently accessible location that allowed the potentially damaging opening of the labyrinth to be avoided. Second, it was a conductive location very close to the labyrinth, but not in contact with inner-ear perilymph. Third, it allowed electrodes to be implanted permanently to allow galvanic stimulation to be delivered in alert animals in behavioural experiments conducted over a period of up to 2 years.  The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), site of the termination of primary baroreceptor afferent nerves !!!REFs!!!, plays a role in cardiovascular regulation !!!REF!!!. This nucleus includes high densities of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing nerve terminals !!!REFs!!!, GABAA and GABAB receptors !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, bilateral injection of either a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol or a GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen into the NTS elicits a prominent pressor response !!!REFs!!!. Both pressor responses can be blocked by injection of either a GABAA receptor antagonist or a GABAB receptor antagonist !!!REFs!!!. Unilateral injection of either a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, or a GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP-35348, elicits a depressor response !!!REFs!!!. In previous studies, bilateral injection of indirectly acting GABA agonists such as nipecotic acid (NIP) or γ-vinylGABA into the NTS elicits a pressor response !!!REFs!!!. In distinction to the effects of exogenous injection of GABA agonists into the NTS, pressor responses produced by potentiating GABA action within the NTS may result from stimulation of GABAB receptors but not of GABAA receptors. The GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, failed to block or attenuate the pressor response elicited by injection of nipecotic acid or γ-vinylGABA into the NTS !!!REFs!!!. Despite some conflicting results, these observations indicate that GABA within the NTS acts at both GABAA receptors and GABAB receptors to tonically regulate arterial pressure (AP). In addition, GABA within the NTS has been implicated in the baroreflex, thereby contributing to the regulation of AP !!!REF!!!. Although high-salt intake may be insufficient in itself to increase AP, it can predispose individuals to a salt-sensitive increase in AP !!!REF!!!. Previous studies have shown an association between elevated sympathetic vasomotor tone and salt-sensitive hypertension !!!REFs!!!. Since the central nervous system (CNS) controls the peripheral sympathetic nervous system !!!REFs!!!, the influence of high-salt intake upon the CNS may contribute to increased AP. This hypothesis is supported by the experiments of Pawloski-Dahm and Gordon, who concluded that high-salt intake might sensitize rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) sympathoexcitatory neurons in a manner that predisposes toward the development of hypertension !!!REF!!!. Another previous study found that, in itself, dietary salt consumption can change the general sensitivity of NTS and RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurons !!!REF!!!. Thus, high-salt intake may alter neural sensitivity in these nuclei without restriction to any particular class of cell surface receptor !!!REF!!!. However, the details of the mechanisms of the NTS effects of high-salt intake remain unclear. The present experiment was designed to further characterize the relationship between high-salt intake and GABAergic mechanisms in the NTS.  The discovery of mutations in a subset of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) !!!REF!!! has spurred interest in examining the role of the encoded protein (superoxide dismutase-1) in this disease. Although no relation was established between SOD-1 aggregates and cell death !!!REF!!!, abnormal protein interactions caused by mutated may be involved in ALS pathogenesis !!!REF!!!. mutations associated with ALS caused novel protein interactions !!!REF!!!. A role for this protein in ALS pathogenesis is also supported by findings of paresis and motoneuron degeneration in transgenic mice with mutations !!!REFs!!!, probably mediated by a gain-of-adverse function, as no such effect was found with the endogenous null mutation !!!REF!!!. In addition to ALS, SOD1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome, characterized by trisomy of human chromosome 21, causing overexpression of a large set of genes including . The gene was the first chromosome 21 gene to be cloned !!!REF!!!. The mouse homologue for several of these genes is situated on chromosome 16 and several transgenic mouse models that mimic part of this disorder are available !!!REF!!!. Transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (wt) were the first genetic model modelling trisomy 21 !!!REF!!!. The role of overexpressed has been linked both to protective and adverse actions !!!REF!!!. On one hand, transgene-induced /wt expression (KT line) promoted survival of mouse cortical neurons exposed to neurotoxins !!!REF!!!. Likewise, cultured midbrain neurons of /wt transgenic mice (SF-218 line) were less susceptible to decay over time than those of non-transgenic controls !!!REF!!!. Moreover, overexpression induced by an adenovirus-based vector protected superior cervical ganglion neurons grown in culture from nerve growth factor withdrawal !!!REF!!!. In /wt transgenic rats, ventral horn motor neurons were more protected than wild-type from programmed cell death after traumatic spinal cord injury !!!REF!!! and CA1 hippocampal neurons were relatively spared after global ischemia/reperfusion !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, there is evidence that SOD1/wt expression promotes neuropathology. For example, /wt transgenic mice from the KT line developed mitochondrial vacuolization in ventral horn, cranial motor nuclei, and subiculum, argyrophilic degeneration in ventral horn, spinocerebellar tracts, cerebellar white matter, ventrolateral caudal medulla, and fornix, together with late-onset (24 months) α-motoneuron loss !!!REF!!!. The same effect but with an earlier onset was found in the N29 Gurney line !!!REF!!!. Although the α-motoneuron loss did not result in paresis, the /wt transgenic mice had poorer sensorimotor performances than non-transgenic controls in the rotorod test at 14 months of age. A detrimental effect of overexpressed SOD1 is also indicated by findings of hypoactivity in an open-field and deficient spatial learning in the Morris water maze in two other /wt transgenic mouse lines (Tg-51 and Tg-69) !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we sought to determine whether sensorimotor functions and anxiety are altered in /wt transgenic mice from the KT line !!!REFs!!!. These mice were generated by injecting human wild-type into fertilized eggs of the FVB/N strain under the control of its own promoter. The 3-month-old hemizygous /wt transgenic mice were compared to non-transgenic FVB/N controls in the SHIRPA (mithKline arwell/mperial College/oyal Hospital/henotypic ssessment) primary screen of neurologic function !!!REFs!!!. The SHIRPA differentiated several transgenic mouse models from controls, including overexpression of a NFH-β-galactosidase fusion protein !!!REF!!!. The FVB/N strain is characterized by relatively high motor activity in the open-field !!!REFs!!! and retinal degeneration caused by the allele of the gene !!!REFs!!!, a likely cause of their poor spatial learning abilities !!!REF!!!. Exploratory activity and anxiety were estimated by open-field !!!REF!!! and emergence !!!REF!!! tests. In the open-field, the distance travelled in the periphery was dissociated from the more anxiogenic central sector !!!REF!!!. In the emergence test, the tendency of mice to remain inside a small, safe compartment and to avoid a larger and anxiogenic one was measured, a test sensitive to null mutations of several neurotransmitter receptors in mice !!!REFs!!! and medial frontal cortex lesions in rats !!!REF!!!. The evaluation was completed by stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests of motor coordination, sensitive to genetic and experimentally-induced lesions of motor-related pathways in mice !!!REFs!!!.  Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in most aspects of brain functions such as cognition, memory, and learning !!!REFs!!!. Glutamate also plays major roles in the development of the brain such as synapse induction and elimination, and cell migration, differentiation, and death !!!REFs!!!. Glutamate concentration in the brain extracellular fluid is estimated to be around 3–4μM, while that in the synaptic vesicle of glutamatergic neuron terminals may reach 100mM. Glutamate plays its signaling role by acting on glutamate receptors !!!REF!!!. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors is harmful, and glutamate is toxic in high concentrations. Excess of glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft induces neurotoxicity associated with numerous pathological processes such as stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis !!!REFs!!!. Thus, it is important to find out a drug to suppress excitotoxicity of glutamate. Several herbal medicines (called drugs in Japan, herbal remedies composed of specified mixtures of dried plant materials) are effective in the field of neuropsychiatry !!!REF!!!. Among them, medicines, which contain () as one of their main crude drugs, have been reported to possess psychotropic actions and are the prescription of choice for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. , one of the medicines in the drugs, has been widely used in a variety of clinical situations in Japan for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders with very low side effects !!!REF!!!. In the present study, the action of in excess of extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampus, which was induced with stimulation with high K+, was examined to find out a drug for prevention or cure of excitotoxicity of glutamate, which is associated with neurological disorders such as ischemia and epilepsy. Zinc-deficient rats, in which glutamatergic and GABAergic systems are affected, may be a neurological disease model !!!REF!!!. Extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampus is more increased by stimulation with high K+ in zinc-deficient rats than in the control rats !!!REF!!!. In the zinc-deficient rats, the lack of the increase in GABA concentration is observed during stimulation with high K+. Furthermore, susceptibility to epileptic seizures is enhanced by zinc deficiency !!!REF!!!. Thus, susceptibility to excitotoxicity of glutamate seems to be enhanced in zinc-deficient rats.  Ethanol interacts with the function of a variety of neurotransmitter systems. This includes increased dopaminergic impulse flow through an opiate receptor mediated system !!!REF!!!, potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), inhibition of excitatory glutamate (NMDA) receptors !!!REFs!!!, release of angiotensin II !!!REF!!! and possibly an agonist-like interaction with adenosine receptors !!!REFs!!!. The search for drugs that will reduce the desire to consume alcohol similarly involves modification of the function of these neurotransmitters. The most obvious example is the use of opiate receptor antagonists to reduce consumption of ethanol in animal models !!!REFs!!! and in humans !!!REFs!!!. Drugs that enhance and diminish serotonergic function have been tried in both animal models and clinical trials with varying degrees of success !!!REFs!!!. The interaction of drugs that alter glutamate receptor function with ethanol has not been fully explored for its therapeutic potential. Ethanol decreases the ability of released glutamate to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus presumably by inhibition of activation of the ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptor !!!REFs!!!. This effect takes place at concentrations within the range obtained in vivo that can produce amnesic “blackouts” in humans !!!REF!!!. In this sense, ethanol may act as a glutamate receptor antagonist. In harmony with this concept, NMDA receptor antagonists from different classes substitute for ethanol in animals trained with ethanol in a two-lever food reward drug discrimination task !!!REFs!!!. Further, both competitive and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists can prevent amphetamine-induced cytotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons as evidenced by prevention of the decline of striatal concentrations of dopamine !!!REFs!!!. NMDA receptors are composed by the assembly of one GluRzeta (NR1) sub-unit with any one of four GluRepsilon subunits (GluRepsilon 1-4; NR2A-D) to form a high Ca2+-permeable cation channel. Mice lacking the GluRepsilon 1 subunit exhibit hyperactivity of their dopaminergic and serotonergic systems !!!REF!!!. In addition, there is a binding site for glycine that enhances the action of glutamate to activate the NMDA receptor. Antagonists of the glycine site are mild muscle relaxants, e.g. racemic HA-966 !!!REF!!! and interact with dopaminergic agonists !!!REF!!!. In contrast, the non-competitive antagonist, MK 801, produces a form of hyperactivity in mice and rats !!!REFs!!!. This means that the NMDA receptor affords several different binding sites through which its activity can be modified and the behavioral responses to ethanol therefore modified. In addition, (+)-HA-966 has an effect to reduce the bursting pattern of both the nigral and ventral tegmental dopaminergic neurons without changing the rate of impulse flow in these neurons that is not shared with other glycine site antagonists !!!REF!!!. The following experiments examined whether drugs known to inhibit NMDA receptor activation will alter the consumption of ethanol in a 24h volitional consumption paradigm. The drugs tested were LY 274614, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK 801, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, (+)-HA-966 and ACPC, strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site antagonists !!!REFs!!!.  Kainic acid (KA), the analog of the excitatory amino acid l-glutamate, upon binding to non-NMDA glutamate receptors, causes depolarization of neurons followed by severe status epilepticus, neurodegeneration, plasticity, memory loss, neuronal cell death !!!REFs!!!. The systemic or intracerebroventriculary (i.c.v.) KA injection produces a pyramidal cell death in CA1 or CA3 region of hippocampus. For example, delayed neuronal death is seen in the rat hippocampus CA1 and CA3 by KA administered intraperitoneally in the cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay !!!REF!!!. Neuronal loss is found in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the rat hippocampus following by i.c.v. KA administration !!!REFs!!!. KA administered i.c.v. induced the lesion of CA3 pyramidal neurons in mice !!!REFs!!!. The phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) is increased by systemic administration of KA in the rat hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. Seizures induce the sprouting of mossy fibers in the CA3 region of rat hippocampus !!!REF!!!. We have also demonstrated p-ERK immunoreactivity (IR) is increased in the mouse hippocampus by KA administered i.c.v. !!!REF!!!. The activation of ERK protein has been reported to be important in determining whether a cell survives or undergoes apoptosis !!!REF!!!, and also in activating some transcription factors !!!REF!!!. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) regulates a number of cellular functions in response to increased intracellular calcium. CaMK II is widely distributed, but is predominantly expressed in the brain. CaMK II is involved in the regulation of neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation, and the formation of spatial learning !!!REF!!!. The CaMK-related peptide and CaMK VI RNA are increased in the rat hippocampus by KA administration !!!REF!!!. A specific inhibitor of CaMK II attenuates the seizure-induced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the adult rat brain and shows a neuroprotection against NMDA- and hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced cell death !!!REFs!!!. KA leads to the induction of several types of hippocampal proto-oncogene products, such as Jun and Fos proteins, which serve as the third messengers !!!REFs!!!. Administration of KA at convulsant dose also induces c-Fos, Fra and Jun in rat hippocampus and entorhinal cortex !!!REFs!!!. The increases of c-Fos and c-Jun induced by KA might be correlated with seizure activity, excitotoxicity or the activation of certain target genes !!!REFs!!!. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the cell specific intermediate filament protein in astrocytes. Reactive astrocytes are characterized by expression of GFAP, hypertrophy and proliferation !!!REFs!!!. After brain injury, astrocytes undergo a number of cellular synthesis and release of a variety of growth factors and immunomodulatory cytokines !!!REFs!!!. Reactive astrocytes perform a variety of adaptive functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including maintenance of ion homeostasis, provision of energy substrate to neurons uptake of neurotransmitters. Reactive astrocytes are detected in mice brain by KA administered i.c.v. !!!REFs!!!. The activation of microglia can be detected using an activated microglial marker, the complement receptor type 3 (OX-42) IR. It is known that KA applied to CA3 region of hippocampus causes selective pyramidal cell death and activates microglial cells !!!REFs!!!. This fact is implicated that phagocytosis of degenerated neuronal elements raises the last step in the microglial activation !!!REFs!!!. Acetylcholine (Ach) is effective to muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) that are widely distributed in the central nervous system !!!REF!!!. The nAchRs are located on cell bodies or dendrites, where they may mediate direct postsynaptic effects, or on axon terminals, where they play a role in modulating synaptic transmission !!!REFs!!!. Neuronal nAchRs belong to the family of excitatory ligand-gated ion channels !!!REF!!!. The hippocampus contains high amounts of nAchRs !!!REFs!!!. However, the role of nAchRs in the regulation of cell death induced by KA administered i.c.v. in mice has not been well characterized. Furthermore, the cellular mechanism of nAchRs involved in KA-induced neurotoxicity has not been well elucidated. Thus, the effects of nAchRs antagonist on KA-induced hippocampal cell death and expression of several intracellular molecules, such as p-ERK, p-CaMK II, c-Fos, c-Jun, GFAP and OX-42 were examined in the present study.  Previous research exploring the effect on carbohydrates on opioid functions have indicated a strong link between the effects of simple sugars on opioid-mediated pain perception. The ingestion of sweet and highly palatable substances has a profound effect on the endogenous opioid systems (EOS). Most of this work has focused on the acute effect of simple sugars and suggests the activation of endogenous opioids in response to consumption of palatable flavors. Dum et al. !!!REF!!! found an immediate release of beta-endorphin from the hypothalamus in response to the consumption of a highly palatable food. In another study, it has been demonstrated that administration of an oral infusion of sucrose in rats causes an immediate, naltrexone-reversible analgesia of short duration !!!REF!!!. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that if rats are given sweet flavored drinking water they develop tolerance to morphine in subsequent tests of analgesia !!!REF!!!. Tolerance to morphine has been observed to start within 24h and increase with prolonged exposure to sweet water up to 5 weeks !!!REF!!!. Apparently ingestion of palatable fluids activates endogenous opioid activity that is involved to some extent in analgesia as well as in reward !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, preliminary findings have indicated that sucrose feeding decreases the severity of opioid precipitated withdrawals !!!REF!!!. Glucose has also been shown to block the tail skin temperature response to naloxone when administered i.p. at doses 5–20gm/kg, 30min prior to the naloxone injection !!!REF!!!. Relationships between sustained sucrose-feeding and opioid tolerance and withdrawal has been reported !!!REF!!!. The present study was intended to re-examine whether the processes activated by ingestion of palatable fluids could suppress the withdrawal syndrome in opioid-dependent rats.  The inner ear of mammals houses the hearing and the vestibular organ systems. The vestibular system consists of two different types of sensory endorgans, one for linear acceleration and one for angular velocity !!!REF!!!. The endorgans for linear acceleration are the utricle and saccule, also known as the otoconia bearing gravistatic sensors. The utricle and saccule use inertia of the otoconia mass to measure relative movement of the otoconia against sensory epithelia fixed to the otic capsule. Such movement is generated when the head is experiencing linear acceleration as in an accelerating car, elevator or by the earth's gravity. In addition, any angular acceleration not centered on a given otoconia organ will result in linear acceleration of otoconia due to centrifugal forces !!!REF!!!. The information provided by these peripheral endorgans reaches the vestibular nuclear complex of the brainstem and the vestibular part of the cerebellum !!!REFs!!!. Information of the linear and angular acceleration sensors of the ear is compared in the brain to eliminate the inherent ambiguity of the otolith system to distinguish gravity from non-gravity-related linear acceleration of otoconia !!!REF!!!, thus guiding postural control of the body, head and eyes. In addition, the gravity sensing mechanism for linear acceleration is complemented by the visual system, numerous proprioreceptive signals derived from muscle spindles in the neck, trunk and limbs !!!REFs!!! and mesenteries !!!REF!!!. Thus, most acceleration will be perceived by stretch receptors in the limbs (body inertia) and thereby add to the completeness of linear acceleration analysis as a whole body response. Integration of these systems in toto has been studied by unilateral or bilateral labyrinthine extirpation and by assessing the residual ability of the entire organism for static and dynamic postural control !!!REF!!!. Also, entire ears or parts thereof, such as otoconia, can be extirpated and the compensatory behavior studied over time in these animals !!!REFs!!! or humans !!!REF!!!. Such acute and long-term operative removal of one or both ears can affect postural muscle composition !!!REF!!! and spatial learning !!!REFs!!!. However, the removal of entire ears and vestibular afferents in adult animals produces a reactive synaptogenesis to replace the degenerating vestibular nerve fibers by non-otic fibers !!!REFs!!!. This reactive synaptogenesis can cause a complex alteration of vestibular response properties, rather than unmasking mechanisms of ongoing vestibular plasticity that continuously adapt the intact vestibular system to altered sensory input. Viable mutant mice exist that lose all sensory hair cells and eventually most sensory innervation !!!REF!!!. These mice thus mimic in a more controlled way inner ear ablation that results in altered homeostatic responses of the organism !!!REFs!!!. However, such loss of afferent fibers will likely also result in reactive synaptogenesis in the vestibular nuclei, thus complicating any further analysis as much as surgical removal of the ear or parts of the ear. Alternative approaches were developed which reduced the sensitivity of the system, for example, by genetically eliminating the tectorial membrane !!!REF!!!. In the semicircular canal system, this was accomplished by plugging one or more canals !!!REFs!!!. This leads to changes in dynamic characteristics and converts the canal system into a high pass filter that is unable to provide the necessary information to help the brain distinguish between gravity and translational acceleration. For obvious reasons, selective manipulations of the gravistatic system have been more difficult to accomplish !!!REF!!!, as they require either eliminating the utricular and saccular otoconia or altering the pattern of linear acceleration by altering gravity. In fact, even a short exposure of 16 days to microgravity stimuli results in plastic reorganization of linear acceleration perception and a reduced ocular counter rolling in astronauts !!!REF!!!, thus highlighting the dynamic nature of the system's response to altered linear acceleration stimuli. Clearly, the most desirable way to reduce input into the gravistatic system in a controlled way is to eliminate the otoconia and thus altering all forms of linear acceleration perception mediated by both gravity and translational acceleration. Recently, several of the proteins that are essential for otoconia formation have been identified !!!REFs!!! and several model mutant mice exist that lack otoconia !!!REFs!!! or have displaced otoconia !!!REF!!!. The spontaneous mouse mutation () was recently identified as a mutation that leads to a non-conservative change of the amino acid residue 151 from an alanine to glutamic acid in the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein, named otopetrin 1 (Otop1) !!!REF!!!. The Otop1 mutants (from hereon referred as ) otoconia free mutant is currently the best characterized at the molecular level. Like other otoconia deficient mutants !!!REF!!!, the mutants lack all perception of linear acceleration !!!REF!!!. These mice lack otoconia, while otherwise developing a fairly normal ear !!!REFs!!!. Mutants are thus an ideal model system to investigate compensation for absence of linear acceleration input of the ear into the generation of the neuronal reference frame for 3D movement perception. Such perception is essential to guide dynamic and static postural control of a mouse without gravistatic or other liner acceleration input !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the mutant mice will lack that sensory input likely without losing vestibular fibers to the vestibular nuclei as is the case in surgical removal of the labyrinth !!!REFs!!!, or genetic ablation of the hair cells !!!REF!!!. Behavioral tests were previously performed in mutant mice lacking otoconia, but were centered on demonstrating an inability to control posture while swimming or staying on a Rota rod bar !!!REFs!!!. Even those simple behavior tests show the remarkable adaptive potential of these otoconia deprived mice !!!REF!!!. To our knowledge, no test has been performed that explores the residual capacity of the mutant mouse for postural control in a more complex balance task that also requires learning. We tested this ability with an elevated bar crossing paradigm which had been shown previously to robustly characterize motor deficits !!!REFs!!! and microgravity mediated balance deficits !!!REF!!!. Our data show that mutant mice can learn to cross a balance bar and acquire a crossing speed that approaches that of control mice. We also show that our test system is sensitive enough to show that the heterozygous (het; Otop1+/ ) mice lie in many aspects of their performance between the wild type (WT) and mutant littermates, suggesting a gene dosage effect on otoconia formation and/or maintenance by the mutated otopetrin protein.  Davis et al. reported that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist nicotine reduces visceral pain in cats !!!REF!!!. Since this early work, numerous studies have confirmed the antinociceptive properties of nicotine in several species of animals using established pain models !!!REFs!!!. More recently, the potent nAChR ligand epibatidine (exo-2(6-chloro-3-pyridyl)-7-azabicycloheptane) has been isolated from the Ecuadorian poison frog Epipedobates Tricolor with antinociceptive potency 80 times that of the opioid morphine, but is not blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone !!!REFs!!!. Further recent evidence suggests that stimulation of the α4β2 nAChR complex plays an important role in these analgesic effects !!!REFs!!!. These findings have prompted interest in epibatidine (EPIB) and chemically related analogs as a potential new class of non-sedating, non-opioid analgesics !!!REFs!!!. The identification of the analgesic properties of EPIB has, for the most part, been conducted in animals exposed to a noxious stimulus, followed by a measured motor response that is interpreted as an index of pain sensation. Although most clinically effective analgesics diminish responding in these models, it may not be readily discerned whether compounds are acting to reduce pain transmission, or are simply blunting motor responding by a non-antinociceptive mechanism. For example, nicotinic agonists like EPIB can decrease motor activity, and thus may increase the latency to respond in a thermal pain test !!!REF!!!. In this case, a non-pain related physiological effect could potentially be misinterpreted as an analgesic effect. Ideally, in conjunction with these behavioral approaches, some functional measurement of pain conducting nerve activity could lend more objective support toward a selective action on pain transmission. Studies to understand the role of endogenous nicotinic-cholinergic systems in pain transmission have been undertaken before and since the initial reports describing the synthesis and analgesic properties of EPIB. These have included the study of the in vitro effects of EPIB on action potential thresholds in isolated human unmyelinated afferent C-fiber nerves !!!REF!!!. C-fibers transmit the sensation of deep, burning pain from dermatomes to the spinal cord. Although the site of nAChR-mediated analgesia remains uncertain, some studies show that nicotine or carbachol have antinociceptive activity when administered in the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, and nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, some laboratories report that intrathecally administered nicotinic agonists only produce a transient analgesia, while producing a more predominant excitatory algogenic effect !!!REFs!!!. Nonetheless, based on systemic administration of nicotinic agonists in animals and humans, the generally accepted view is that the net effect of nAChR stimulation is antinociception. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that EPIB, at one or several levels of the neuraxis, could have inhibitory effects on pathways involved in pain transmission. Nociceptive flexor reflexes have been studied in humans and a good correlation exists between subjective sensation of pain and the objective measurement of the reflex !!!REF!!!. This reflex serves the purpose of evoking a rapid flexor muscle contraction and limb withdrawal from noxious stimuli. The general composition of the reflex loop includes primary A- and C-fiber afferents whose nerve endings arise from cutaneous and deep tissue, and synapse onto neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Flexor muscle motor neurons are activated by these afferents polysynaptically through a series of interneurons in the spinal cord that are under modulatory control of descending supraspinal regions. The complexity of these circuits is described in detail elsewhere !!!REFs!!!. The human flexor reflex is a sensitive measure of clinical analgesia induced by spinally and systemically administered opioids !!!REFs!!!. Electromyographic (EMG) activity related to the C-fiber flexor reflex can also be recorded non-invasively in the rat, and several analgesics, including those of the NSAID and opioid classes, show effects in this in vivo model that are similar to analgesic responses observed in humans !!!REFs!!!. In anesthetized rats, an electrical stimulus applied to the hindpaw in the region of the sural nerve evokes two EMG bursts in flexor muscles; one early response associated with A-fiber activation and a later burst associated with C-fiber activation. The aim of this study was to provide functional evidence for nAChR-mediated antinociception. The rat nociceptive flexor reflex model was utilized to determine whether the afferent C-fiber component of this reflex is affected by the potent nAChR agonist (±)-epibatidine in a way consistent with effects reported for known analgesics. This approach would offer a more direct measurement of pain transmission and corroborate, or possibly refute, the findings reported for EPIB in behavioral models of pain. Although several compound classes have been investigated for effects on nociceptive reflexes, to our knowledge, the effects of nicotinic-cholinergic antinociception on C-fiber reflexes have not been reported. EPIB was compared with morphine and the NMD A receptor antagonist MK-801, both of which are reported to suppress nociceptive flexor reflex measured C-fiber activity !!!REFs!!!. The selectivity of EPIB for nicotinic receptors in this model was also determined by pretreatment of rats with the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. In another pharmacological experiment, a nicotinic antagonist that does not cross the blood–brain barrier, chlorisondamine, was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV). The purpose of this was to determine whether central blockade of nicotinic receptors could block or attenuate the effects of EPIB, thus implicating a central site of action. It has been shown in behavioral models of nociception that an analgesic effect can be obtained when EPIB or nicotine are administered in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) !!!REFs!!!. Thus, EPIB was also administered into the NRM to determine whether this supraspinal structure is involved in the analgesic properties of EPIB. The investigations into understanding the mechanism of EPIB has included determining whether, like the opioids, antinociception can be induced at the level of the spinal cord !!!REF!!!. Reports of the spinal actions of EPIB are suggestive of a transient antinociceptive effect that is considerably weaker than that seen with systemic or supraspinal injection !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, a potent stimulatory algogenic effect is also reported when EPIB is administered intrathecally !!!REFs!!!. Thus, in the present study, we also took the approach of administering EPIB into the spinal cord to determine whether excitatory or inhibitory effects are exhibited on the C-fiber reflex response.  Stress plays an important role in the onset of affective disorders. Ample evidence is accumulating from human as well as animal research that females react differently to stressors than males !!!REFs!!!. While females are more susceptible to the development of affective disorders, preclinical stress research has focussed mainly on male animals and therefore little is known about the neurobiology of females coping with stress. As stress has negative effects on mental health, social support is known to have positive effects on stress-coping and there are some indications of a gender difference in the effect of social support. Psychotherapy that could be viewed as formalised social support, improves symptoms !!!REF!!! and normalises brain activity in depressed patients, similar to antidepressant treatment !!!REF!!!. This suggests a neurobiological basis for the ameliorating effects of social support/psychotherapy. Recent studies suggest that symptoms of depression are thought to be related to reduced synaptic plasticity in the brain !!!REF!!!, possibly resulting in the inability to respond and/or adapt to aversive stimuli. Reduced levels of neurotrophins have been found in the brains of depressed patients !!!REFs!!!. One of the neuroanatomical changes found in depressed patients is a decreased hippocampal volume !!!REF!!!, which might be reversible after recovery from the depression !!!REFs!!!. This reduction of hippocampal volume might be related to a stress-induced decrease in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, as found after stress-exposure in rodents !!!REF!!! that can also be reversed by antidepressant treatment !!!REF!!!. Chronic stress exposure in rodents has been proposed as a valid animal model for affective disorders. Chronically stressed rats show symptoms characteristic of depression, like anhedonia and sleep disturbances !!!REFs!!!, but most studies were performed in male rats only. Since rats are social animals, social housing during stress exposure could provide an interesting model to study the neurobiological effects of social support. We have previously shown that social housing in unisex groups ameliorates stress-coping in female rats but not in males. In male rats social housing appeared to increase the stress-sensitivity, and only isolated control males showed no signs of stress, whereas isolation by itself appeared to be stressful for females !!!REFs!!!. Environmental enrichment has been shown to increase neurogenesis !!!REF!!!. Although social housing does not qualify as environmental enrichment !!!REF!!!, it apparently affects the way animals cope with stress, which might be reflected in the number of new neurons born or the survival of these neurons. Rats were injected with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 5 consecutive days to eliminate estrous-cycle related variation of neurogenesis in females !!!REF!!!. The last injection was given 2 weeks before the end of the stress exposure, in order to investigate the long-term effect of chronic stress on neurogenesis. However, the effects, evident after 3 weeks of stress exposure, could be due either to differences in cell proliferation during the time BrdU was present or to changes in survival of newly generated cells during the 2 subsequent weeks. Several studies have shown that stress decreases cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) in male rats !!!REF!!!. So, in a follow-up experiment we investigated if females also showed this stress-induced decrease in cell proliferation.  The availability of dopamine D2/3 receptors for binding of [11C]raclopride and other benzamide radioligands in living brain is influenced by competition from endogenous dopamine !!!REF!!!. Thus, pharmacological challenge with d-amphetamine and other psychostimulants increases the extracellular dopamine concentration and consequently decreases the fraction of dopamine D2/3 binding sites available for [11C]raclopride binding in studies of mice !!!REF!!!, cats !!!REF!!!, monkeys !!!REFs!!!, and humans (see !!!REF!!!). Similarly, we have detected nicotine-induced reductions in [11C]raclopride binding in the striatum of Danish Landrace pigs, which we attribute to pharmacological potentiation of dopamine release !!!REF!!!. Corroborative PET studies in the monkey indicate that the amphetamine-induced reduction in [11C]raclopride binding exceeds in magnitude that evoked by nicotine !!!REF!!!. We have recently reported the effects of acute treatment with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on [11C]raclopride binding in brain of living pig !!!REF!!!, but corresponding effects of d-amphetamine are unknown. Female rodents are more sensitive than males to the psychomotor stimulant effects of amphetamines !!!REFs!!!, a phenomenon, which has been linked to estrogen-mediated enhancement of the magnitude of dopamine release !!!REFs!!!. In PET studies of healthy humans, dopamine synthesis capacity is greater in striatum of women !!!REF!!!, whereas the apparent affinities for [11C]raclopride suggest a higher basal occupancy of the D2/3 receptors by dopamine in female brain !!!REF!!!. However, it is unknown if gender differences influence the magnitude of amphetamine-evoked changes of [11C]raclopride binding in living brain. Therefore, we recorded the cerebral uptake of [11C]raclopride in baseline and post-amphetamine conditions in age-matched groups of six male and six female Göttingen minipigs and generated maps of the specific binding potential pB of [11C]raclopride, which were then co-registered to a common stereotaxic coordinate system for minipig brain !!!REF!!!. Statistical parametric mapping was used to test the hypothesis that [11C]raclopride binding is more sensitive to d-amphetamine-evoked dopamine release in the female as compared to male pigs.  Oral dyskinesia is an important phenomenon with implications for a series of neuropsychiatric conditions including Parkinson's disease !!!REFs!!!, Huntington's disease !!!REF!!! and Alzheimer's disease !!!REF!!!. Among these disorders, one of the most critical is tardive dyskinesia—the most serious iatrogenic movement disorder—which is, by definition, a late-onset adverse effect of prolonged administration of neuroleptic drugs !!!REFs!!!. In this respect, reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia has been suggested as a putative animal model of tardive dyskinesia !!!REFs!!!, as well as a model of an acute oral dyskinesia with features similar to parkinsonian tremors !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, in view of the general clinical relevance of oral dyskinesia, this is an important model that can be used to gain more knowledge about this issue regardless of its controversies. We recently described that the GABA mimetic drug valproic acid—which increases the amount of GABA by stimulating the activity of the GABA synthetic enzyme and inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes—inhibits the manifestation of reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia !!!REF!!!. In addition, we have also verified that the GABAA agonist tetrahydroisoxazolopyridine (THIP) and the GABAB agonist baclofen, but not the benzodizepine diazepam, also abolish the manifestation of reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia (Abílio et al., submitted). These results indicate that not all GABAergic drugs share an antidyskinetic property. In this context, the aim of the present work was to extend the study of GABAergic drugs on the manifestation of reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia by investigating the effects of topiramate, a new anticonvulsant drug that enhances GABA-evoked Cl− flux by binding to a modulatory site on the GABA receptor !!!REFs!!!.  Dystonia is an involuntary movement disorder characterized by twisting or sustained movements !!!REF!!!. Recently, continuous electrical stimulation also called deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the Globus Pallidus internus (GPi) has been shown to be an effective treatment for patients suffering from primary or secondary dystonia !!!REFs!!!. However, evaluating the outcome after surgery remains a major concern !!!REF!!!. One characteristic feature of the post-operative period for dystonic patients is the long response time to electrical stimulation from several hours to several months. Often, this makes the adjustment of stimulation parameters a long and tedious process. During this period of parameter adjustment, it is of primary importance to evaluate the changes in the clinical state of the patient and to be able to detect subtle changes validly as soon as they occur and with minimum discomfort for the patient. Dystonia rating scales are numerous. Presently, the most frequently used scale is the Burke–Marsden–Fahn's Dystonia Rating Scale (BMFDRS) !!!REFs!!!. The BMFDRS quantifies dystonia in nine different body parts by rating the provoking factor of dystonic symptoms as well as the severity of the manifestations with a maximal severity score of 120 points. However, this scale is not detailed enough to assess the complexity of involuntary movements and muscle tone of dystonic patients receiving DBS. Moreover, it requires a large experience in the management of patients with this disease. A sensitive, noninvasive, and simple to use instrument, such as an ambulatory accelerometer, which can detect changes in movement acceleration, could complement the BMFDRS. Accelerometry has been previously used to study normal and disordered movements. The possibility to assess tremor by measuring wrist or finger acceleration has been shown already !!!REFs!!!. Hoff et al. !!!REF!!! and Keijsers et al. !!!REF!!! investigated acceleration in Parkinson's disease patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Hoff et al. found a high correlation (above 0.80) between the mean amplitude in two frequency bands of the power acceleration spectrum and the clinical scores for the wrist using a modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. To our knowledge, no similar attempt has been reported so far in the literature to evaluate dystonic symptoms with an accelerometric method. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to use an accelerometer to develop a quantitative measure based upon limb acceleration. While the analyses performed tend to be limited with ordinal type measurements (e.g. clinical scales such as the BMFDRS), these analyses can be done with more accuracy and power in studies using ratio type measurements. One of the most significant symptoms of dystonia is the inability to write and to perform precise gestures with the dominant hand. We observed that during DBS for dystonia the recovery of normal writing is the last and most difficult result to achieve. This is why we hypothesized that a quantitative assessment of the right (dominant) arm activity could provide relevant information to the clinician. We chose to use a commercialized ambulatory accelerometer, accessible for physicians and, in the future, for patients at home with eventual electronic transmission of results to a medical center. We investigated power spectra of limb acceleration in patients before and after the onset of bilateral electrical stimulation of the GPi.  Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, results in progressively increasing tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity, as well as alterations of cognition and affect. Current pharmacological treatment to replace dopamine (DA) is initially effective, though palliative, eventually losing its efficacy. Therefore, the use of cell replacement therapy as a long-term treatment of neurodegenerative disease has been of great interest. Transplantation of fetal neurons ameliorate behavioral deficits in animal models of PD !!!REFs!!!. Human fetal neurons have also been transplanted into human patients with PD !!!REFs!!!, and initial controlled human clinical trials indicate the potential of this type of therapy for long-term treatment of PD, though many protocol details must be refined !!!REFs!!!. Neuronal progenitor, neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells have also been considered as alternative cell sources for cell replacement therapy !!!REFs!!!. The unique ability of embryonic stem cells to give rise to all somatic cell lineages !!!REFs!!! make them an especially promising source for cell therapy. However, it has proven difficult to reliably control their expansion and differentiation !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, the therapeutic use of human embryonic stem cells and fetal cells is fraught with ethical issues. Greater success has been reported for the expansion and differentiation of multipotent adult stem cells toward the desired neuronal phenotypes !!!REFs!!!, though, again, the instructive cellular signals controlling their differentiation, especially in vivo, are similarly not adequately understood. The ideal cellular source for transplantation therapy in PD would be an easily expanded cell that reliably differentiates to a dopaminergic phenotype, releases dopamine, and remains dopaminergic for the life of the graft. Additionally, the ideal cellular source should elicit a minimal host–graft response in the transplant recipient. The NTera-2/clone D1 (NT2) cell, a cell line derived from a human teratocarcinoma, has been used extensively to study neuronal differentiation !!!REFs!!!. The NT2 cell line is easily expanded, and differentiates into immature neurons following 4–5 weeks of treatment with retinoic acid !!!REFs!!!. These post-mitotic NT2N neurons, which have also been called hNT or LBS neurons, have phenotypic and morphological characteristics of immature neurons !!!REFs!!!. When differentiated with retinoic acid, NT2N neurons express a variety of neurotransmitters !!!REFs!!!, with approximately 10% of the neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, after 5 weeks of retinoic acid differentiation !!!REFs!!!. Dopaminergic NT2N neurons have been shown to engraft within the central nervous system and have been used successfully in ameliorating the behavioral deficits associated with stroke !!!REFs!!!, neurodegenerative disease !!!REF!!! and spinal cord injury !!!REFs!!!. Sertoli cells (SC) are found within the testis, where they secrete a number of growth factors that are believed to help maturation of spermatids and protect the developing sperm from immunosurveillance !!!REF!!!. Many of these growth factors are neurotrophic. We have previously shown that co-culturing rat fetal midbrain neurons with SC enhanced the number of TH-positive (TH+) neurons in vitro !!!REFs!!! and in vivo !!!REF!!!. Additionally, a number of lines of evidence suggest that SC may provide immunoprotection to transplanted cells !!!REFs!!!. They do not express major histocompatability factor (MHC) II, and express little MHC I !!!REF!!!. Both allografts of rat and xenografts of pig SC survive in the rat brain for 2 months without immunosuppression of the recipient !!!REF!!!. Moreover, SC produce an unknown soluble factor that inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) production as well as IL-2 induced lymphocyte proliferation !!!REFs!!!, and when co-transplanted with dopaminergic neurons enhance the survival of the transplanted neurons in recipient rats that are not systemically immunosuppressed !!!REF!!!. Cells cultured in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors originally developed by NASA to simulate conditions of microgravity organized into tissue constructs that express tissue-specific markers !!!REFs!!!. This culture system has also been shown to effect the differentiation of cells grown in the RWV, as compared to those grown in conventional static cultures. For example, PC12 cells have been shown to aggregate and adopt a neuroendocrine phenotype when grown in the RWV, but not in conventional culture !!!REF!!!. Similarly, neural stem cells !!!REF!!! and progenitor cells !!!REF!!! can be induced to differentiate when cultured in the RWV. We have previously reported aggregation of NT2 cells with Sertoli cells using the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) RWV bioreactor to create a transplantable tissue construct that may provide a readily available source of dopaminergic neurons !!!REF!!!. We report here that NT2 cells within the Sertoli–NT2-aggregated-cell (SNAC) tissue construct rapidly differentiate to a dopaminergic phenotype in the absence of retinoic acid.  The active components of marijuana, the cannabinoids, act via at least two cannabinoid (CB) receptors: CB1, preferentially located in central and peripheral neurons and CB2, mainly located in immune cells !!!REF!!!. CB1 receptors have been found in the digestive system !!!REF!!!, where they mediate several functions, including inhibition of gastric acid secretion !!!REFs!!!, gastric emptying and contractility !!!REFs!!!, intestinal motility !!!REFs!!! and secretion !!!REF!!!, as well as increase of gastric mucosal defense !!!REF!!!. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the antisecretory effects of CB1-receptor agonists was evident against indirectly acting secretagogues, such as 2-deoxy-d-glucose and pentagastrin, but not against histamine, suggesting an action on vagal pathways to the stomach and/or on enterochromaffin-like cells !!!REF!!!. In subsequent studies we have demonstrated that immunoreactivity to CB1 receptors was present in neural elements innervating smooth muscle, mucosa and submucosal vessels !!!REF!!!. In keeping with this, CB1 receptor expression was found in peripheral neurons of the myenteric plexus in different animal species !!!REFs!!!. However, the significant role of the central nervous system in the regulation of gastric acid secretion !!!REF!!! from one hand, the presence of endogenous cannabinoids in the brain and, finally, the distribution of CB1 receptors in brain areas that control gastrointestinal functions, such as the dorsal vagal complex !!!REFs!!! suggest the possibility that cannabinoids may influence gastric acid secretion also by central mechanisms. Indeed, both central and peripheral sites of action for CB-mediated inhibitory effects on intestinal motility have been suggested by some authors !!!REF!!!. The present study was designed to investigate whether central mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of gastric acid secretion induced by two synthetic CB-receptor agonists, the aminoalkylindole WIN55,212-2 and the tricyclic cannabinol derivative HU-210 !!!REF!!!. These compounds were tested against basal and pentagastrin-induced acid secretion, after either intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration in the anaesthetized rat with lumen-perfused stomach.  In spite of intensive research the mechanism of drug dependence is not clearly understood. The long-term behavioural changes observed in animals exposed to gradually increased doses of opioid drugs may help to know more about this phenomenon. The different types of opioid-receptors affect the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) transmission that seems to play important role in their behavioural effects. μ and δ opioid-receptor agonists have been shown to stimulate, whereas κ opioid-receptor agonists to suppress the mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission !!!REF!!!. The stimulatory effect of μ and δ opioid-receptor agonists is supposed to be exerted at the level of ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of the mesolimbic DA-ergic system. κ opioid-receptor agonists exert their inhibitory effect via presynaptic inhibition of DA nerve terminals in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) !!!REFs!!!. Morphine (MO) displays dual effect on the locomotor activity (LA), depending on the dose and on the time elapsed after the treatment. At the beginning of the observation period reduction of activity (sedation) is observed, followed by hyperactivity !!!REF!!!. Both tolerance to these acute effects and sensitisation to the hyperactivity have been reported using various species of experimental animals and applying different treatment regimens and experimental methods !!!REFs!!!. Continuous exposure to MO results in development of tolerance to its analgesic and also to some behavioural effects, like sedation or reinforcement !!!REFs!!!. Administration of naloxone (NX), the μ-preferring, non selective opioid-receptor antagonist to rats pretreated with repeated doses of MO does not only precipitate the symptoms of physical dependence, but induces behavioural changes, too. Thus conditioned place aversion (CPA) induced by NX is much more pronounced in MO-pretreated animals !!!REFs!!! than in MO-naive ones !!!REF!!!. A decrease in LA was also observed !!!REF!!!. The majority of these experiments were done after short-term MO treatment or implantation of MO-containing pellet. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the rats exposed to rapidly increasing s.c. doses of MO respond to an acute MO, a non-selective opioid-receptor antagonist NX and a selective δ opioid-receptor antagonist naltrindole (NTI) challenge. LA of animals was tested at different time points following withdrawal of MO administration. A higher dose of MO (10mg/kg) was applied for studying the development of tolerance to the hypoactivity-inducing effect and a smaller one (3mg/kg) was applied for studying the development of tolerance to the hyperactivity-inducing effect.  Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious neurological syndrome characterized by involuntary orofacial movements, involving mouth, face, and tongue, and sometimes limb and trunk musculature. TD is most frequently found in older patients using typical antipsychotic agents and this syndrome can be irreversible, persisting even after treatment discontinuation !!!REFs!!!. The molecular basis of TD has been discussed by different groups; but its pathophysiology remains unclear (!!!REFs!!! for review). The majority of hypotheses which try to explain TD are consistent with the neuronal degeneration in specific brain regions !!!REFs!!!. From a mechanistic point of view, the free radical hypothesis of TD has gained extensive experimental support in literature as the basis for neurodegeneration !!!REFs!!!. In fact, individual attributes in the capacity to handle increased free radicals could account for why some people develop TD and others do not !!!REFs!!!. The free radical hypothesis of aging asserts that the generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species increase with aging, which results in oxidative damage to critical biological molecules !!!REFs!!!. This offers a satisfactory explanation for why TD increases with age !!!REFs!!!. In line with this, Bergamo et al. !!!REF!!! reported that oral dyskinesia induced by reserpine was more pronounced in old rats than in the adult animals. Similarly, other studies have reported that orofacial movements increase with aging !!!REFs!!!, reviewed by Waddington !!!REF!!!. Haloperidol administration stimulates the release of glutamate in the striatum !!!REF!!! and long-term administration of haloperidol to rats elevate striatal ROS in vivo !!!REF!!!. Brain imaging studies in TD have reported structural changes in striatal neurons !!!REF!!! and they have been connected with glutamatergic activity !!!REF!!!. Similarly, the study of patients with TD has also shown an increase in glutamatergic activity and oxidative stress !!!REF!!!. Of particular importance for TD therapy improvement, there are points of evidence in the literature showing that antioxidant treatment can be effective in animal models !!!REFs!!! and in humans with TD !!!REFs!!!. The development of new drugs that can help in preserving neuronal integrity are under current investigation. In this context, seleno-organic compounds have been studied based on their potential antioxidant properties !!!REFs!!!. In fact, this class of compounds exhibits glutathione peroxidase-like activity and oxidizes-SH during the reduction of H2O2!!!REFs!!!. Of particular importance, ebselen produces an antioxidant activity in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of neurotoxicity in rats !!!REFs!!!. Recent data from our laboratory indicated that ebselen plays a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and reverses the increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) production caused by reserpine administration !!!REF!!!. The simplest of diaryl diselenides, diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2], has been shown to be even more active as a glutathione peroxidase mimic !!!REF!!! and less toxic to rodents than ebselen !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, (PhSe)2 has synthetic potential !!!REF!!! and anti-inflamatory, antinociceptive and neuroprotective activities !!!REFs!!!. Considering the importance of the tardive dyskinesia, its relationship with age and the oxidative stress, the authors examined the possible protective effect of (PhSe)2 on reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia in old rats. In addition, since tardive dyskinesia can be caused by free-radical overproduction in the brain, the effects of reserpine and (PhSe)2 on cerebral tissues lipid peroxidation were also examined by measuring TBARS.  Since the first demonstration that cholinergic degeneration in the basal forebrain is associated with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease !!!REF!!!, research on central cholinergic functions has grown exponentially. Based on a variety of drug and lesion approaches, many experiments have demonstrated that septohippocampal and basalocortical cholinergic processes are involved in memory and attention !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, it has been shown that changes in hippocampal cholinergic functions accompanied learning, and that impairment (e.g., by lesions) or stimulation (e.g., by drugs) of these functions inhibited or enhanced memory, respectively !!!REFs!!!. Unfortunately, over the past, most lesion experiments lacked neurochemical selectivity (electrolysis, aspiration, injections of excitotoxins, etc.) and, therefore, provided no certainty about the cholinergic contribution to memory dysfunction, although they often induced dramatic deficits (e.g., in water-maze or radial-maze tests). For about 10 years, it has been shown that cholinergic neurons of the septal region can be damaged selectively by intraseptal injections of 192 IgG-saporin, an immunotoxin composed of saporin, a ribosome-inactivating protein, coupled to 192 IgG, a monoclonal antibody directed against p75NTR receptors, which in turn are selectively expressed by cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain !!!REF!!!. Surprisingly, almost all studies based on intraseptal injections of this toxin failed to demonstrate severe memory impairments in tests known for their sensitivity to damage to the hippocampal formation !!!REFs!!!. Whether memory deficits appear following immunotoxic lesions of cholinergic neurons probably depends upon several factors such as the extent of cholinergic damage !!!REFs!!!. One may also consider the sensitivity of the tasks to measure spatial memory and learning vis-à-vis disruption of septohippocampal cholinergic projections. For instance, it is possible that rats subjected to such lesions may retain the ability to perform some spatial tasks, either because these tasks lack complexity, or because of multiple strategies used to solve them; cholinergic lesions may alter only some of these strategies. Also, most approaches focusing on cognitive effects of 192 IgG-saporin lesions in the basal forebrain used radial- and/or water-maze tests !!!REFs!!!. As such tests tax spatial memory processes, one may wonder what the effects of 192 IgG-saporin lesions would be in a complex task with only a minimal spatial load. The Hebb-Williams test, which was developed to assess general intelligence in rats !!!REF!!!, is such a test when used in its standard version. So far, this test has never been used following 192 IgG-saporin lesions. It consists in a series of 12 different problems designed by Rabinovitch and Rosvold !!!REF!!! and provides a fairly extensive sampling of behaviour. As it may detect deficits that do not appear in other tests !!!REFs!!!, this test might be particularly suitable for detecting weak or subtle deficits. In the present study, it was used to assess the effects of a partial 192 IgG-saporin lesion in rats. Previous experiments showed that although overall performance improves when rats are tested through the entire series of 12 problems, the relative differences found between groups on the first test are preserved on a second one, which makes it feasible to conduct repeated series of 12-problem testing !!!REF!!!. Thus, we used such a repeated testing approach to investigate the effects of 192 IgG-saporin in interaction with scopolamine treatment. Scopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist and blockade of muscarinic receptors of the brain is known to alter cognitive functions !!!REF!!!. Our hypothesis was that rats with partial lesion would be more sensitive to scopolamine and that the dose-response curve of performance would be influenced by the lesion.  The term “pain” applies both to an unpleasant experience linked to a physical damage and to the feeling of emotional suffering accompanying anxiety and depression. Pain is applied to a variety of subjective phenomena ranging from the perception of noxious stimuli to excruciating pain associated with terminal cancer, thalamic syndrome, or trigeminal neuralgia. Therefore, pain is considered to be a multifactorial phenomenon in which biochemical, humoral, neurophysiological, and psychological factors are integrated. Primary afferent fibers transmit sensory information and have central processes that terminate primarily in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and brain stem. Activation of primary afferent nociceptors results in the release of several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators including substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neurokinin A, and glutamate !!!REF!!!. There are many receptor subtypes that have been implicated in transmission of nociceptive information in the dorsal horn, which include alpha-2 adrenoreceptors, tachykinins (substance P, neurokinin A), opioid (mu and delta), and glutamate (AMPA and NMDA) receptors. The production of nitric oxide may take place secondary to activation of NMDA receptor and influx of Ca2+ !!!REF!!!. It has long been recognized that microglia migrate to differentiate and proliferate at sites of brain injury and inflammation, and activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits microglial cell chemotaxis !!!REF!!!. It is interesting that interleukin-2 involved in inflammatory processes exerts analgesic actions !!!REF!!!. Functional relation exists between mu opioid receptors and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, and clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is analgesic in nature. Opioid receptor immunoreactivity is found in substance P containing neurons, and delta opioid receptors modulate the release of substance P. Mu opioid receptors are localized in GABAergic neurons, and flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, enhances the analgesic action of morphine !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, opioid receptor modulate NMDA receptor-mediated actions !!!REF!!!. Present treatments for acute and/or chronic pain rely on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and norcotic analgesics. However, there are various persistent painful conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases that respond poorly to existing analgesics and hence await novel therapeutic avenues. Physicians have noted since antiquity that their patients complained of less pain and required fewer analgesics at night times !!!REF!!!. In human, the circulating levels of melatonin, a pineal substance with analgesic and hypnotic properties, exhibit a pronounced circadian rhythm with serum levels being high at night and very low during day times !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, melatonin exhibits maximal analgesic effects at night, pinealectomy abolishes the analgesic effects of melatonin, and opioid receptor antagonists disrupt the day–night rhythm of nociception !!!REF!!!. Previous studies have suggested that opioidergic peptides influence the synthesis of melatonin. For example, the subcutaneous injection of des-tyrosine-γ-endorphin increased melatonin levels !!!REF!!!, and morphine stimulated the release of melatonin from the rat pineal gland !!!REFs!!!. Subsequently, the presence of opioid peptides derived from three precursors, namely, pro-opiomelanocortin, pro-enkephalin, and pro-dynorphin have been detected in mammalian pineal gland by radioimmunoassay !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, by utilizing immunohistochemical techniques, the presence of opioidergic nerve fibers have been demonstrated in the pineal gland of guinea pig !!!REF!!!, human !!!REF!!!, cow !!!REF!!!, European hamster !!!REF!!! and tree shrew !!!REF!!!. In addition, the immunoreactive intrapineal neuronal-like cells !!!REFs!!!, as well as pinealocytes !!!REF!!! containing enkephalin, were also observed in the pineal gland of guinea pig, human and European hamster. In recent years, Govitrapong et al. !!!REF!!!, and Aloyo !!!REF!!!, by using [3H]diprenorphine, have reported the existence of opioidergic receptors in the bovine pineal gland. Moreover, Bzdega et al. !!!REF!!! have found that, in the mouse brain, the delta opioid receptor is expressed in low levels but its transcripts are found in large amounts, particularly in the anterior pituitary and pineal gland. Several studies indicated that melatonin exerts analgesic effects !!!REFs!!!. The analgesic effects of melatonin were attenuated by naloxone and benzodiazepines (BZP) antagonists suggesting its relationship with opioid and BZP receptors !!!REF!!!. Moreover, melatonin treatment not only reversed the morphine-induced tolerance and dependence but also augmented the morphine-induced analgesia !!!REFs!!!. However, the exact mechanisms how melatonin induces analgesia is still poorly understood. In the present study, we intended to learn in detail the pharmacodynamics of melatonin-induced analgesia by characterizing the opioid receptor subtypes and defining the effects of melatonin receptor agonists and antagonists on the opioid receptor binding. Furthermore, we intended to learn whether or not melatonin altered the release of endogenous opioids.  Leptin has been shown to modulate the function of the sympathetic nervous system, central nervous system (CNS) peptides as well as several peptides of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal or gonadal axes !!!REFs!!!. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) leptin administration results in an increase in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in normal rats !!!REF!!!. Subsequent studies demonstrated a leptin-directed cascade of events where leptin acted to stimulate the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) leading to an increase in the production of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and β-endorphins. It was these products of the POMC peptide that directly increased the MAP !!!REF!!!. Studies have shown that histaminergic neurons which are mainly concentrated in the tuberomamillary nucleus (TM) of the posterior hypothalamus innervates and influence central cardiovascular regulatory related structures, especially nuclei of the anterior and medial hypothalamus and the nucleus of the solitary tract !!!REFs!!!. The central pressor effect of exogenous histamine, as a result of increase in sympathetic activity and secretion of arginine vasopressin has been widely confirmed in a number of species !!!REF!!!. In normotensive rats histamine given i.c.v. evoke a rise in blood pressure accompanied by tachycardia in anesthetized animals and bradycardia in conscious animals !!!REF!!!. Leptin has been demonstrated to promote histamine turnover by affecting the post-transcriptional process of histidine decarboxylase formation or histamine release !!!REF!!!. In addition, studies in Zucker fatty rats, which have a mutation in the leptin receptor gene demonstrated a decrease in both histamine concentration and the activity of histidine decarboxylase, a key enzyme that synthesize histamine from l-histidine, in the hypothalamus of these animals !!!REFs!!!. Histaminergic projections to the paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and arcuate nucleus indicate that neuronal histamine may influence neurohormonal network via carotid releasing hormone (CRH), neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and POMC neurons !!!REFs!!!. In fact histamine has been shown to induce the release of α-MSH, a POMC-derived peptide !!!REF!!!. Hypothalamic histamine has been demonstrated to play a role in the central signaling pathways that are involved in the leptin's regulation feeding behavior !!!REF!!!. We have previously demonstrated that both α-MSH and β-endorphins can act centrally to increase sympathetic nervous outflow and demonstrated that these responses are correlated with an increase in cardiovascular dynamics !!!REFs!!!. It has been demonstrated that leptin modulates feeding behavior through activation of the central histaminergic system via histamine H1 receptors !!!REF!!!. We hypothesize that histamine may contribute to or mediates leptin's effects on cardiovascular dynamics. We also hypothesize that histamine via histamine H1 receptors mediates the cardiovascular actions of leptin. In the present study, we investigated the cardiovascular responses produced by the central administration of histamine, leptin and α-MSH both in the presence and absence of histamine H1 antagonist.  Within the nervous system, individual neurons are exposed to many environmental signals, which influence their form and function. Prominent among these signals are growth factors and neurotransmitters !!!REF!!!. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), members of the heparin-binding polypeptide growth factor family !!!REFs!!!, are protein mitogens originally identified as promotors of fibroblast division in culture !!!REFs!!!. In 1930s, it was described that pituitary and brain extracts cause a high mitogenic activity of fibroblasts. Purification procedures soon revealed the presence of two compounds, an acid one and a basic one, sharing 60% homology, which were called acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF) fibroblast growth factors, respectively. These molecules exert their effects on a large spectrum of cells, comprising fibroblasts and endothelial cells and on nerve tissue including neurons and glial cells !!!REF!!!. Although in vivo effects of bFGF are not well understood, in vitro actions of bFGF on mesenchymal and neuroectodermal cells include induction of or increase in proliferation, mitogenesis in glial cells, the support of neuronal survival, the promotion of neurite outgrowth !!!REFs!!!, morphological changes, anchorage-independent growth, differentiation, delayed senescence, angiogenesis, neovascularization, tissue differentiation, regulation of tissue specific functions !!!REF!!!, wound healing !!!REF!!!, other regenerative processes, abnormal cell differentiation and growth (tumor-growth) !!!REF!!!. Taken together, these observations suggest that bFGF may be of importance for the development and maintenance of nervous system. Aging is accompanied by a decline in cognitive function such as learning and memory, along with a variety of neurobiological changes !!!REFs!!!. Hippocampal formation, which plays a critical role in spatial memory, is extremely sensitive to the aging process and appears to be one of the first regions to show structural and physiological changes with advancing age !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, age-dependent cognitive impairment might be related to a decline in hippocampal plasticity, which, in turn, may depend on alterations in growth factor expression. In order to gain an understanding of the effect of aging on bFGF immunoreactivity within the rat hippocampus, we used a highly specific mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant bFGF.  The problem of infant malnutrition raises growing interest, and several studies have aimed to define the relationship between nutritional status and cell growth or maturation in the brain. These studies have indicated a marked vulnerability of the developing nervous system to changes in the environment, particularly when these changes occur during the so-called “brain growth-spurt period” !!!REFs!!!. In humans, this corresponds to the period between the last trimester of fetal life and the third postnatal year. In the rat, this period corresponds to the first three postnatal weeks, i.e., the lactation period, when developmental phenomena such as neurogenesis, gliogenesis and myelination peak, though at different times depending upon the brain region. Malnutrition may alter brain histogenesis, causing a variation of the proliferation rates of neural and glial progenitor cells, and can induce alterations in the regulation of several neurotransmitters !!!REFs!!!. Such alterations vary in different brain regions and lead to adaptive changes in metabolic and behavioural patterns !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, the alterations induced by malnutrition can variably dissociate brain structure from its function. The severity of the effect depends upon the timing, intensity and duration of the nutritional disturbance !!!REFs!!!. The brain circadian timing system acts as a multioscillatory device, playing a key role in the adjustment of the animal to its environment. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (SCN) and the thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) are important components of this system involved in photic and non-photic information processing, used to entrain behavioural and physiological responses to exogenous cues. The timing of the endogenous pacemaker localised in the SCN is synchronised to the external light–dark cycle. This is achieved primarily through information relayed to the SCN directly from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), and indirectly from the IGL, i.e. via the geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT), which contains neuropeptide Y (NPY). The GHT- and serotoninergic projections from the raphe nuclei are also believed to convey behavioural entraining input to the SCN. Efferent projections of the SCN transfer rhythmicity to centers subserving the regulation of endocrine, autonomic and behavioural functions (reviews in !!!REFs!!!). Studies carried out to analyse the effects of malnutrition on the temporal organisation of behaviour have pointed out alterations of circadian rhythms in malnourished rats. A phase delay was reported in the rhythm of food- and water intake !!!REF!!! and in the plasma level of melatonin !!!REF!!!. A cosinor analysis of behavioural patterns, such as grooming, drinking, eating, exploring, curling up and lying down, revealed a reduced amplitude and mesor in malnourished rats during early life !!!REF!!!. Using different nutritional paradigms, several studies have demonstrated alterations induced by malnutrition on the synchronisation of circadian and homeostatic mechanisms driving sleep, especially rapid-eye-movement sleep !!!REFs!!!. Aguilar-Roblero et al. !!!REF!!! analysed the circadian organisation of drinking behaviour under different lighting conditions, and observed a splitting of the rhythmicity under the light–dark cycle in chronic malnourished rats. Long-lasting alterations in the circadian rhythm of cortical temperature oscillation were also detected after chronic protein malnutrition !!!REF!!!. The changes observed in the studies mentioned above suggested that malnutrition may affect the expression of circadian rhythmicity in processes such as entrainment to light–dark cycles, coupling among oscillators or transmission of rhythmicity to the effectors !!!REF!!!. According to this hypothesis, malnutrition may affect the structures involved in the circadian timing system, such as the SCN and/or their afferent and efferent projections !!!REF!!!. To our knowledge, only two studies, adopting chronic low-protein malnutrition (6% casein) from 5 weeks before mating, have been carried out so far on this subject. Cintra et al. !!!REF!!! reported a reduction in the size of three cell types in the SCN, especially in young rats at the age of 30 days. Aguilar-Roblero et al. !!!REF!!! observed a decrease in the number and density of cells immunopositive to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, vasopressin and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the SCN of adult rats of 150 days of age. The latter study !!!REF!!! also described in the SCN a 8% reduction in the number of afferent fibres containing serotonin, while no difference was observed in the NPY-containing axon terminals deriving from the GHT. However, the organisation of the IGL and RHT has not been analysed so far in malnourished animals. The aim of the present study was to investigate in young rats whether chronic malnutrition induced by a multideficient diet from gestation or lactation could alter the development of components of the circadian timing system involved in the entrainment of physiological responses to the light–dark cycle. The multideficient diet adopted in the present study is called the “regional basic diet” (RBD) and has been used as experimental model of malnutrition in several studies on its neural effects !!!REFs!!!. RBD is rich in carbohydrates and fibres but poor in vitamins, minerals, fats, and contains a low concentration of proteins, which derive predominantly from vegetables. RBD reproduces, in this latter aspect, the diet common in malnourished human populations of several developing countries. The RBD-induced malnutrition can lead to significant alterations in physiological !!!REFs!!!, metabolic, and behavioural parameters !!!REFs!!!. Considering the RBD protein deficiency, both in quantity and in quality, we hypothesised that chronic malnutrition induced by this diet could affect the neurogenesis or development of retinal ganglion cells or IGL neurons containing NPY, or induce plastic changes in the terminal fields of the RHT or GHT in the SCN. By using anterograde axonal tracing combined with Nissl staining and immunohistochemical approaches, we evaluated the pattern of organisation of retinofugal terminals and the size of the SCN, retinal ganglion cell density, and the NPY immunoreactivity pattern of GHT fibres in the IGL and SCN.  Activity-dependent increases in synaptic efficacy such as long-term potentiation (LTP) are studied extensively in view of their putative role in learning and memory !!!REF!!!. Briefly, specific patterns of synaptic activation give rise to a relatively “short-lasting” form of potentiation (1–2h; early LTP) or to a longer-lasting potentiation (beyond 2–3h; late-LTP) depending on neural activation history !!!REFs!!!. There is a general consensus that LTP maintenance (i.e., late-LTP) is stabilized by new synaptic growth orchestrated by gene expression. Consequently, certain molecular products have been linked to LTP !!!REF!!! and prominent among them is growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43; also termed neuromodulin, B-50, F-1, or pp46: !!!REFs!!!). However, the signaling pathway coupling neural activity and GAP-43 expression and how this, in turn, is linked to LTP is unclear. With this in mind, we set out to determine if dopamine DA1 receptor (DA1R) pathways couple GAP-43 expression and LTP maintenance. We focused on the dopaminergic transductory pathway since published data already implicate the involvement of DA1R activation for LTP maintenance !!!REFs!!!. For example, selective DA1R agonists (e.g., SKF38393) induce a slowly developing potentiation across CA3/CA1 synapses lasting beyond 6h !!!REF!!!. In contrast, selective DA1R antagonists (e.g., SCH23390) block LTP maintenance !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, mice lacking DA1Rs develop early-LTP but not late-LTP !!!REF!!!. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the effects of DA1Rs activation may involve modulation of gene expression underlying LTP maintenance. We present in this report data that link DA1R activation to both up-regulation of GAP-43 and the occurrence of late-LTP in the guinea pig hippocampus in vivo.  Zinc, after iron, is the second most abundant trace element in the mammalian tissue, and is essential for development, growth, DNA synthesis, immunity, and a wide array of cellular processes !!!REFs!!!. It is known that most zinc is tightly bound to macromolecules to maintain the three-dimensional structure of a wide variety of proteins or to serve as a cofactor of a large number of enzymes !!!REFs!!!. A small amount of zinc ions are free or weakly bound to the host molecules, and they are chelatable with zinc specific fluorescence dyes, such as zinquin !!!REF!!! and 6-methoxy 8-para toluene sulfonamide quinoline (TSQ) !!!REF!!!, and histochemically detectable with Timm staining or autometallography (AMG) !!!REFs!!!. In the central nervous system (CNS), the histochemically detectable or chelatable zinc (approximately, 10–15% of total brain zinc) is mainly located in the synaptic vesicles of a subset of neurons !!!REFs!!!. Neurons that contain free zinc ions in the vesicles of their pre-synaptic boutons have been termed zinc-enriched (ZEN) or zinc-containing neurons !!!REFs!!!, or “zinc-ergic” neurons !!!REFs!!!. ZEN neurons have been found throughout the mammalian CNS, but appear to be most abundant in the telencephalon. Studies from the hippocampus, amygdala and neo-cortex revealed that ZEN neuron in the forebrain represent a subgroup of excitatory glutamatergic neurons !!!REFs!!!. However, recent studies have shown that inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic ZEN neurons exist in the spinal cord and the cerebellum !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that vesicular zinc may contribute to synaptic neurotransmission and neuromodulation of the two major neurotransmitter systems, the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. After release from pre-synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft zinc may modulate the postsynaptic receptors, including GABA, -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and α-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainite receptors !!!REFs!!!. Although, zinc is present in high amounts in the CNS, very little is known about zinc metabolism in the CNS !!!REFs!!!. Zinc cation is a small hydrophilic ion and can not freely cross-biological membranes by passive diffusion. Recently identified mammalian zinc transporters (ZnTs) are believed to participate in zinc trafficking across membranes in living cells !!!REFs!!!. Since 1995, seven members of the ZnT family have been cloned and characterized and are referred as to ZnT1–7. ZnTs are membrane-bound proteins with similar structures, consisting of six transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich loop, that is, supposed to be an important part of zinc binding. ZnT1 serves as a zinc ion efflux transporter of the cells and is expressed ubiquitously on the plasma membrane in a variety of tissues, including the brain !!!REFs!!!. ZnT2–4 are located on the vesicular membranes and have a similar structure and function, i.e. to transport zinc ions into intracellular vesicles. ZnT2 is abundantly expressed in intestine, kidney and testis and accumulate zinc ions in endosomal or lysosomal compartments !!!REF!!!. ZnT3 is restrictedly expressed in the nervous system !!!REFs!!!, and one of its important functions is presumably to sequester zinc ions into pre-synaptic vesicles of ZEN neurons, since no histologically detectable zinc can be found in ZnT3 knockout mouse brain !!!REF!!!. The expression of ZnT4 is enriched in mammary gland, intestine, as well as in the brain !!!REFs!!!, implying some specific roles in intracellular zinc homeostasis in these tissues. ZnT5 is homologous in the carboxyl-terminal portion with other members in the ZnT family, i.e. six membrane-spanning domains, but not in the amino-terminal portion, because it has a long amino-terminal portion, containing 410 amino acids. ZnT5 is responsible for transporting zinc into secretory granules in insulin-containing pancreatic β cells !!!REF!!!. ZnT6 and ZnT7 are structurally and functionally similar but have differential tissue localizations. ZnT6 and ZnT7 facilitate the translocation of the cytoplasmic zinc into the Golgi apparatus !!!REFs!!!. In some pathological conditions, zinc ions and ZnTs may be involved in cell death and the plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) !!!REFs!!!. Several lines of studies showed that the cerebellum contains a significant amount of zinc ions !!!REF!!! and the concentrations of zinc change dramatically during development and in pathological conditions in the cerebellum !!!REFs!!!, however, very little is known about the zinc homeostasis in the cerebellum. Recently, it has been reported that a ZEN inhibitory GABAergic system exists in the mouse cerebellum !!!REF!!!. In order to gain further insight on whether ZnT1, ZnT3, ZnT4 and ZnT6 are involved in zinc homeostasis in the cerebellar region, we explored cellular localization of ZnT1, ZnT3, ZnT4 and ZnT6 in the mouse cerebellar cortex.  Sexual differentiation of the brain function is known to occur during the perinatal period in the rat. Conspicuous sexually dimorphic features are estrus-cyclicity and the sexual behavioral pattern in mammals. These functions are controlled by the hypothalamus: by the prepoptic area (POA) for cyclicity !!!REFs!!!, and by the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) and the septum for female sexual behavior !!!REFs!!!. During the perinatal period, the presence of androgen or estrogen causes these functions to become the male type, consisting of acyclic estrus and low lordosis !!!REFs!!!. In perinatal rats, testosterone in the neurons is converted by aromatase in many brain areas that are concerned with estrous cyclicity and lordosis. In the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain, substances that act on the receptor for estrogen have the potency to cause the male brain to lack cyclicity and have a low female sexual behavioral pattern. Many estrogenic substances, such as bisphenol A or nonylphenol, are known to exist in industrial products !!!REF!!!. Plants also contain many kind of estrogenic compounds, such as phytoestrogen !!!REFs!!!, one of which is isoflavone !!!REFs!!!. A considerable amount of evidence suggests that isoflavone acts as an estrogenic agent on reproductive functions in experimental animals !!!REF!!!. One of the potent isoflavones is genistein (GS) in the soybean. Although, GS has the capacity to bind to estrogen receptors (ER) !!!REF!!!, this substance is used as an antiestrogen, because the estrogenic activity of this phytoestrogen is thought to be weaker than that of estradiol and prevents estrogen from binding to the receptor !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, there are reports that GS acts as an agonist of the estrogen receptor in the neonatal period in rats, because a daily injection of 1mg GS for 5 days from birth induced an acyclic condition and low lordotic activity in female rats !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, injections of 1mg GS for 10 days in the neonatal period caused the male type of sexually dimorphic nucleus to appear in the POA and a low response of LH secretion of the pituitary to GnRH !!!REFs!!!. GS has been reported to have a 20-fold higher affinity to ERβ than to ERα !!!REF!!!. In addition to isoflavones, coumestrol (CM), which belongs to the coumestans, is also known to be a potent phytoestrogen, which is obtained from clover and alfalfa sprouts !!!REF!!!. Similar to GS, CM has been reported to have a higher affinity to ERβ than to ERα and its binding affinity to ERβ is comparable or superior to that of estradiol !!!REF!!!. Neonatal feeding with CM influences development of the reproductive functions !!!REFs!!!. However there is no clear evidence for the effect of CM on sexual differentiation of the brain. In this experiment, to clarify the estrogenic potency of coumestrol on sexual differentiation of the regulatory systems for estrous cyclicity and female sexual behavior, female rats were injected neonatally with CM and their female reproductive functions were analyzed in adulthood.  It is well known that many avian species are photoperiodic and respond to long day length with an activation of reproductive function. Three structures or organs have been proposed to contain receptors that respond to changes in day length and are utilized to prepare an organism for seasonal events. They include the eyes, pineal gland and encephalic photoreceptors (EPRs). In at least two avian species, House Sparrow () !!!REFs!!! and American Tree Sparrow () !!!REF!!!, the eyes and pineal have little, if any, role in the photoperiodic control of reproductive function and possibly other seasonal events in the annual cycle. Research has therefore focused upon EPRs as the most important source of information required for essential timing of seasonal behavioral and physiological functions, such as migration, molt, mating behavior and gonadal development. Two sites in the brain, the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and lateral septal organ (LSO) have been proposed to house EPRs (reviewed in !!!REF!!!). Of the two sites, the lateral septal organ (LSO), a structure proposed to be a circumventricular organ !!!REF!!! is a promising candidate for housing EPRs. A large population of cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSFcn) that show immunoreactivity to antibodies directed to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and a monoclonal antibody for rat rhodopsin, RET-P1 !!!REFs!!! are seen in the LSO. The objective of the study was to determine the role of the LSO and its proposed group of EPRs to affect gonadal development of male chicks when placed under environmental conditions that should stimulate rapid gonadal development. The LSO was surgically lesioned bilaterally. If that circumventricular organ truly contained a population of EPRs, then surgical removal should significantly attenuate reproductive growth and development. We tested that hypothesis in a group of male chicks placed in a long day and fed a compound, sulfamethazine (SMZ). That combination has been shown to effect rapid sexual maturation by releasing high levels of gonadotropins suggesting that SMZ may operate by augmenting the stimulatory effects of long photoperiods !!!REFs!!!.  Intracranial pressure measurements have been previously conducted in rabbits !!!REFs!!!. Abe et al. !!!REF!!! placed an epidural balloon in right hemisphere of rabbits and examined pressure changes in both hemisphere and intraventricular area. Beiner et al. !!!REF!!! measured the increase in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow changes in rabbits. Gyring et al. !!!REF!!! measured both lateral ventricule and subarachnoid pressures after fluid infusion to one of the lateral venticules in rabbits. Intracranial field is divided into three compartments, as left and right supratentorial and infratentorial regions via falx and tentorium structures. Several experimental studies demonstrated that pressure resulting from a pathology in one of these fields could be transmitted to the others !!!REFs!!!. However, there is no study in the literature comparing the pressure distribution of the four compartments as right supratentorial, left supratentorial, infratentorial and intraventricular with evaluation of the temperature distribution of the relevant areas. The aim of this study is to analyze the intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral temperature (CT) dispersion in the three compartments and intraventricular field of the rabbits with a balloon placed on the epidural space of the right hemisphere.  The high rate of relapse to opioid use following prolonged periods of abstinence is a major clinical problem in detoxified opioid addicts and remains the most difficult challenge for treatment of drug abuse. Drug craving is a subjective feeling experienced by human drug addicts which motivate them to drug seeking and, even long-time after withdrawal, can produce relapse to drug use !!!REFs!!!. It is very difficult to directly evaluate craving in laboratory animals but it is possible to measure relapse directly in a determined operant event: when a laboratory animal reinitiates a particular behavioural response, often referred to as reinstatement !!!REF!!!. This response seems to reflect the re-induction of craving, leading to drug seeking following a period of extinction of drug use. The animal model mainly used to study relapse to drug seeking has been the extinction-reinstatement model of i.v. self-administration. In this procedure, laboratory animals are trained to make a response, such as pressing a lever, to self-administer a drug and after extinction of that behaviour the ability of several stimuli to reinstate the response is determined !!!REF!!!. It has been observed that a priming injection of the previously self-administered drug, the presentation of environmental cues associated with drug taking and the exposure to stressors result in the reinstatement of responding !!!REF!!!. The paradigm of conditioned place preference (CPP) has also been used recently to study the relapse phenomenon to cocaine and opiates !!!REF!!!. In this procedure, animals are first trained to acquire a CPP and afterwards they undergo a process of extinction of this preference. In agreement with the results obtained previously with the self-administration paradigm, it has been observed that the exposure to the drug !!!REFs!!!, to environmental cues associated with the drug !!!REF!!! and to stress !!!REFs!!! are the main factors inducing relapse to drug seeking after extinction. The principal anatomic substrate of reward produced by drugs of abuse seems to be the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system !!!REFs!!!. The activation of this system is associated with reward and/or the feeling of euphoria, which originates the intake of drugs !!!REF!!!. A large body of evidence indicates that the mesocorticolimbic DA system contributes to the acute reinforcing effects of opioids !!!REFs!!!. Opiates activate DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) through the inhibition of the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, which subsequently increase the DA transmission to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) !!!REFs!!!. However, it appears that this DA pathway may not be the only one responsible for opioid reward. The VTA and NAcc received glutamatergic projections !!!REFs!!! from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) !!!REFs!!! and limbic areas !!!REFs!!!. Both cortical (glutamatergic) and tegmental (DA) neurons terminating in GABAergic neuronal spines in the NAcc seem to have integrative functions !!!REF!!!. In accord with this, biochemical studies have demonstrated the regulation of DA release by glutamate !!!REF!!! and NMDA receptors !!!REF!!!. A frequent localization of mu opioid and NMDA glutamate receptors is observed in brain areas such as periaqueductal grey neurons !!!REF!!!, dorsal raphe nucleus !!!REF!!! and Nacc !!!REF!!!. In the shell of the Nacc, there is a functional association involving mu opioid and NMDA glutamate receptors, the output of single neurons being dually modulated by the activation of both receptors in the same dendrites or by the combined activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors in afferents contacting dendrites which contain mu opioid receptors !!!REF!!!. It is also known that glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in the acute rewarding effects of opioids !!!REF!!! and in the development and expression of behavioural and neurochemical sensitisation to opioids !!!REFs!!!. Although DA and glutamate are clearly involved in the rewarding effects of opiates, only a few studies have investigated the role of these neurotransmitter systems in the reinstatement of opiate-seeking behaviour. It was found that the manipulation of DA neurotransmission blocks the heroin-induced reinstatement of self-administration !!!REFs!!!, while studies on the effect of the manipulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission on opioid-induced reinstatement have not been performed. Moreover, no experiments have investigated which neurotransmission systems are involved in the reinstatement of place preference induced by priming injections. To our knowledge the present work represents the first study aimed at investigating the effects of dopaminergic and glutamatergic NMDA antagonists in the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP with morphine primes. The specific objectives of the present study were: (1) to investigate the role of DA and glutamate neurotransmission in relapse, studying the effects of the DA and NMDA glutamatergic antagonists in a previously extinguished CPP induced by morphine, and (2) to provide evidence of the role of these neurotransmission systems in drug-induced relapse, studying the effects of DA and NMDA glutamate antagonists on the reinstatement properties of morphine. To this purpose, we performed two experiments. Firstly, we studied the effects of SCH 23390, raclopride, haloperidol and CGS 10746B, a D1, D2, D1+D2 DA antagonists and a DA release inhibitor, respectively, on the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, alone or with morphine primes. Secondly, the effects of two NMDA glutamatergic antagonists with different kinetic profiles, memantine and MK-801, on the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, alone or with morphine primes, were evaluated.  A clear relationship exists between hippocampal rhythmical synchronous activity (RSA, theta rhythm, 5–10Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and behaviour in rats. Hippocampal RSA is present during ‘type 1 behaviour’ (or ‘voluntary movement’), including behaviour such as walking, running, rearing, swimming, and changes in body posture. During ‘type 2 behaviour’ (‘automatic movement’ and awake immobility), including body grooming, face washing, and awake immobility, hippocampal RSA activity is mostly absent !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, hippocampal theta rhythm has been suggested to code for some aspects of motor behaviour !!!REFs!!!. Amongst others, a positive relationship between speed of locomotion and RSA frequency has been described !!!REFs!!!. However, some studies report no correlation !!!REFs!!!. γ-Vinyl GABA (vigabatrin) is an irreversible GABA transaminase inhibitor that elevates GABA levels throughout the brain !!!REF!!!. Indeed, after 500mg/kg of vigabatrin GABA concentrations are significantly increased throughout the brain, including the hippocampus !!!REF!!!. Interestingly, this dose of vigabatrin drastically reduces locomotor activity in rats, while also inducing sudden short high-speed running episodes !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, 500mg/kg of vigabatrin decreases theta/RSA peak frequency !!!REF!!!. The high speed running episodes and decreased theta peak frequency after 500mg/kg vigabatrin administration seem contradictory to a positive relationship between speed of locomotion and RSA frequency as found in drug-free conditions !!!REFs!!!. Thus, the combination of decreased theta peak frequency and high speed running movements suggests that vigabatrin might influence the relationship between theta peak frequency and locomotor speed. In the present study, the relationship between theta/RSA peak frequency and locomotor speed under influence of vigabatrin versus controls, in both spontaneous and forced walking conditions, was investigated in rats. The relationship between speed of locomotion and theta peak frequency can clarify whether theta is related to motor activity. Furthermore, if vigabatrin affects this possible relationship it suggests the involvement of GABA in the underlying mechanisms of this relationship.  Balance control has often been thought of as an automatic or reflexly controlled task and thus was expected to use minimal attentional resources. However, evidence that postural control demands attention under certain circumstances has come to light !!!REF!!!. The main types of experimental paradigms used were dual task paradigms, most studies having shown interference between the activity of maintaining balance and performance of mental tasks !!!REFs!!!. Many activities in everyday life require the person to complete several tasks concurrently, and dual task interference may occur if finite general attentional capacity limits are exceeded !!!REFs!!!. The extent to which the performance declines in one of the tasks indicates the extent to which the two tasks share attentional resources !!!REF!!!. However, another school of thought argues that impaired functioning results from two tasks competing for the same resources because they have similar processing demands !!!REF!!!. The effects of mental tasks on postural control have been shown to be differentiated according to the age of individuals !!!REF!!!. In healthy young adult, cognitive activity can have beneficial effects on postural performance, suggesting a high attentional capacity !!!REF!!!. Postural improvement could result either from a tighter control strategy !!!REF!!! or from an increase in stiffness !!!REF!!!. Moreover, alteration in balance performance generated by disruptive situations can be moderated or compensated by an added cognitive load, suggesting a reduction in exploratory movement behaviour !!!REF!!!. In elderly people, balance difficulties are common and lead to an increased incidence of falls !!!REF!!!. This age-related postural instability is induced by dysfunction at every functional stage of postural regulation !!!REFs!!!, especially as cognitive processing ability and attentional resources are excessively challenged during routine activities and tasks of daily living !!!REF!!!. Dual-task activity has a greater impact on motor tasks, e.g. balance control, in older adults than in young adults !!!REFs!!!, especially as the elderly have a history of falls !!!REF!!!. This age-related difference in balance is increased by cognitive tasks involving the visual-spatial sketchpad component of working memory, according to the higher age-related reliance on vision as a result of proprioceptive and/or vestibular loss !!!REF!!!. More specifically, studies on auditory stimulation have already reported that stationary or moving auditory fields have a destabilising influence on postural sway behaviour !!!REFs!!!, and also that, under the appropriate conditions, postural sway can be driven by the auditory environment !!!REF!!!. Moreover, interference with postural regulation has mainly been reported in less stable postural positions, especially where the centre of foot is in an eccentric position, in relation to the higher attentional requirements necessary in more difficult situations !!!REF!!!. In this respect, it has been shown that a lateral moving auditory stimulation produces higher lateral sways in the elderly than in younger individuals, especially in visual deprivation and proprioception diminution conditions !!!REF!!!. Besides, other authors have evaluated the effects of stationary auditory stimulation in sighted and blind subjects, showing that symmetric bilateral auditory stimulation can reduce head movements and lateral body sways in both groups !!!REF!!!. Attention and cognitive load may influence the central processing of information required for the perception and control of orientation !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, body orientation is one of the main components of postural regulation, particularly through the important role of vestibular, visual and proprioceptive information and its integration into the vestibular nuclei !!!REFs!!!. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in the elderly, the differential repercussions of two rotary meaningful and non-meaningful auditory stimulations on static postural control, in order to determine whether the physical characteristics and cognitive dimension of the auditory stimulation can drive postural activity and also be an information source in balance regulation.  The development of gene therapy approaches for the neuroendocrine system, while incipient, has already generated a core of results which emerge as a promising area of research for the treatment of pituitary tumors (for reviews see !!!REFs!!!). Initial studies demonstrated that adenoviral and herpes simplex type 1 (HSV1)-derived vectors could be used to efficiently transfer different types of genes into normal rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells in primary culture as well as in the corticotropic AtT20 and somatomammotropic GH3 tumor cell lines !!!REFs!!!. More recently, an adenoviral vector, RadTK, harboring the HSV1 thymidine kinase () suicide gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter has been used to transfer the gene to GH3 and AtT20 cells. Incubation of RAdTK-treated GH3 and AtT20 cells with the prodrug ganciclovir (which after phosphorylation by viral becomes toxic) caused a significant destruction of the cultures !!!REF!!!. Gene therapy using an adenoviral vector harboring the gene under the control of the human growth hormone (hGH) or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter was effective for destroying GH3 and AtT20 pituitary tumor cells in vitro, respectively, and for treating nude mice carrying subcutaneous GH3 and AtT20 tumors !!!REFs!!!. A regulatable dual-adenoviral vector system possessing the sequence coding for the tetracycline-dependent transcriptional trans-activator (tTA), driven by the human prolactin (hPRL) promoter, was successfully used to achieve cell-type specificity and control of expression in lactotrophic and somatotrophic cells in vivo !!!REF!!!. Also, an HSV1-derived vector has been shown to be effective to transfer genes in rat pituitary prolactinomas !!!REF!!!. Although cell-type-specific suicide gene therapy approaches have been highly successful in pituitary tumor cell lines !!!REFs!!! and ectopic pituitary cell tumors !!!REFs!!!, this approach has been ineffective for the in situ treatment of experimental rat pituitary tumors !!!REF!!!. Even, when in situ AP tumor suicide gene therapy was attempted using adenoviral vectors expressing the gene under the control of strong viral promoters, a reduction in tumor weight of only 30% !!!REF!!! or less (our own unpublished results) was achieved. In order to determine the cause of primary pituitary tumor resistance to suicide gene therapy, we undertook to study the tissue diffusion characteristics and transgene expression distribution of an adenoviral and a HSV-derived vector, both harboring the transgene, in rat experimental prolactinomas. Viral vector impact on tumor apoptosis levels and hormone secretion was also assessed. The present report describes our findings.  Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) mediate the effects of mineralocorticoids by transcriptional activation or repression of target genes. MR are involved in regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including transport of ions, metabolism, energy expenditure and synthesis of factors involved in signal transduction pathways. It has been well established that mineralocorticoids are synthesized in the adrenal gland and play important role in regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance by actions exerted on epithelial cells of the renal distal tubule !!!REFs!!!. Growing number of studies provides also evidence that the brain and the heart are the two other sources and target organs for mineralocorticoids !!!REFs!!!. The first evidence that the brain mineralocorticoids are involved in regulation of blood pressure was provided by Gomez-Sanchez !!!REF!!! and Brody et al. !!!REFs!!!. Subsequent studies have shown that the brain MR contribute to generation of stress-induced pressor response !!!REF!!!, development of hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt), spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Dahl-S rats !!!REFs!!! and to activation of the sympathetic system in heart failure !!!REF!!!. There is also evidence for presence of the intracardiac mineralocorticoid system and its involvement in pathogenesis of hypertension !!!REFs!!!. However, little is known about regulation of expression of MR at the genomic level in the hypertensive states. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to find out whether the expression of MR mRNA in the brain, heart and kidney is altered in the Goldblatt two kidney, one clip (2K,1C) hypertension, which is associated with significant activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system !!!REF!!!. Results reveal that expression of MR mRNA in the brain stem, heart and renal medulla of the 2K,1C hypertensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats is reduced in comparison to MR mRNA expression in the same regions of the sham operated SD rats. Preliminary results of some of these data have been submitted for scientific meeting as an abstract !!!REF!!!.  The prefrontal cortex, due to its role in cognition, emotion and motivation, is a relevant area for understanding the normal process of aging !!!REF!!!. The prefrontal cortex contains intrinsic glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons that are reciprocally interconnected !!!REFs!!!. Glutamatergic terminals arising from other cortical areas and the thalamus and GABAergic terminals arising from the ventrotegmental area have been shown to synapse on neurons in the prefrontal cortex !!!REFs!!!. Also, the prefrontal cortex receives an important projection from cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain that synapse onto the glutamatergic pyramidal neurons !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, an imbalance between the neurotransmitters glutamate–GABA–acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex could be associated with the cognitive deficits that occur during aging !!!REFs!!!. Several neurobiological changes have been described in the prefrontal cortex of the rat during the normal process of aging !!!REFs!!!. For instance, the activity of cholinergic neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex seems to be altered during normal aging !!!REFs!!!. Also, changes in the cortical glutamatergic system, such as an atrophy of the dendritic tree or a reduction in the number and function of ionotropic glutamate receptors, has been described !!!REFs!!!. However, few studies have been devoted to investigate the effects of aging on the interaction of neurotransmitters in this area of the brain !!!REFs!!!. Based on pharmacological and cloning studies, eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) with splice variants have been identified and classified into three groups based on sequence homology, pharmacology and transduction mechanisms !!!REFs!!!. Specific age-dependent changes in the expression and binding of these receptors have been described in the frontal cortex of the rat !!!REFs!!!. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible changes during aging of the effects of the activation of mGluR on the release of GABA and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex of the awake rat. For that the agonist of mGluR, (1,3)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD), was perfused (through the microdialysis probe) in the prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats of different groups of age. ACPD is a non-selective agonist active at all groups of mGluR although with lower affinity for group III receptors !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, perfusion of ACPD through the microdialysis probe at the doses used should produce the simultaneous stimulation of all mGluR in the prefrontal cortex.  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder resulting from degeneration of dopaminergic neurones within the substantia nigra. Several studies have estimated rates of progression of the disorder, with both the loss of nigral dopamine (DA) neurons and the decline of striatal dopamine activity seen to change at rates of 5–10% per year !!!REFs!!!. This discovery led to the use of Levodopa (l-dopa) to enhance synaptic dopamine transmission !!!REFs!!!. Even if l-dopa remains the gold standard for PD treatment, long-term l-dopa therapy is confounded by the development of adverse fluctuations in motor response !!!REFs!!!. Dyskinesia can be broadly sub-classified as choreic (hyperkinetic, purposeless dance-like movements) and dystonic (sustained, abnormal muscle contractions). The neural mechanisms that underlie dyskinesia in PD are far from clear but they have been associated with pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, downstream changes in proteins and genes, and abnormalities in non-dopamine transmitter systems !!!REF!!!. In order to study and clarify these mechanisms, rodent and monkey models have been developed. Despite the widespread use of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats !!!REF!!!, some scepticism has been expressed about modelling parkinsonian symptoms and treatment-related dyskinesias in rodents !!!REF!!!. It has been suggested that only primates may be physically capable of showing the repertoire of movement disorders, which are displayed by patients !!!REF!!!. However, Cenci et al. !!!REF!!! have described a rodent model in which repeated injections of l-dopa in unilaterally DA-denervated rats induced dyskinetic- and dystonic-like movements affecting the head, trunk and forelimb, which clearly resemble the clinical manifestations observed in PD. A similar model has been suggested by Steece-Collier et al. !!!REF!!!. Attention must now focus on the selection of sensitive behavioural tests to assess the recovery of the parkinsonian symptoms with l-dopa in dyskinetic rats. In the present study, we have reproduced the l-dopa-induced dyskinesia model developed by Cenci et al. and used the forelimb placing test !!!REF!!! to test the anti-parkinsonian effects of l-dopa. We have also used selective dopamine receptor antagonists and agonists in order to study the relative contribution of the different DA pathways in the anti-parkinsonian effects and side effects of l-dopa.  The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), GDNF !!!REF!!!, neurturin (NRTN) !!!REF!!!, artemin (ARTN) !!!REFs!!! and persephin (PSPN) !!!REF!!! belong to a distant branch of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. All GFLs have been shown to influence various neuronal populations in the central nervous system, including midbrain dopamine neurons and motoneurons. GDNF, NRTN and ARTN also promote survival and regulate differentiation of a number of peripheral neurons, such as sympathetic, parasympathetic, sensory and enteric neurons (for review see !!!REFs!!!). The cellular responses to GFLs are generally assumed to be mediated by a multicomponent receptor complex composed of the common RET membrane-bound tyrosine kinase !!!REFs!!! and members of a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored family of receptors named GDNF family receptor α (GFRα). GFRα1 is the preferred receptor for GDNF !!!REFs!!!, but it can also bind NRTN !!!REFs!!! and ARTN !!!REF!!!. GFRα2 !!!REF!!! has a preference to NRTN, but it also binds GDNF !!!REFs!!! and interacts with ARTN !!!REF!!!. GFRα3 !!!REF!!! binds only to ARTN !!!REFs!!!. GFRα4 is the preferred receptor for PSPN !!!REFs!!!, but also interacts with GDNF, NRTN and ARTN !!!REF!!!. The complex containing GFL and GFRα homodimers, then brings two molecules of RET together, triggering autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in their tyrosine kinase domains leading to intracellular signaling (for review see !!!REF!!!). RET activated intracellular signaling cascades have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in cell lines and/or in primary neurons !!!REFs!!!. In the light of recent findings, however, a more complex biology of GDNF signaling has to be considered, an observation, which may likely hold for the other GDNF family members as well (for review see !!!REF!!!). Interestingly, GDNF in complex with GFRα1 was demonstrated to interact with heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans !!!REFs!!! to activate the Met receptor tyrosine kinase through cytoplasmic Src-family kinases !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the neurotrophic effect of GDNF, except in motoneurons, has been reported to require the presence of transforming growth factors β, which activates the transport of GFRα1 to the cell membrane !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, GDNF was found to signal independently of RET but through the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM !!!REF!!!. This observation was supported by Chao et al., by showing both in vitro and in vivo, that effects of GDNF on midbrain dopaminergic neurons were inhibited by an NCAM-blocking antibody !!!REF!!!. GDNF is expressed throughout the rat CNS with relatively high levels in the developing striatum !!!REFs!!!, and low levels in the ventral mesencephalon !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, NRTN and GDNF are differentially regulated during postnatal development with a progressive decrease in NRTN mRNA expression in ventral mesencephalon and a progressive increase in the striatum !!!REFs!!!, coincident with a decrease in GDNF mRNA expression !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, no ARTN mRNA expression has been detected in the ventral midbrain of embryonic rats at E14 !!!REF!!!, whereas PSPN has been shown to be expressed prenatally at high levels in the ventral mesencephalon and at low levels in the striatum !!!REFs!!!. GFLs may therefore act in a sequential and coordinated manner to regulate the development of dopaminergic neurons, which may be greatly dependent on the distribution and availability of the different GFRα receptors and reflect the differences in affinity and/or efficiency in the interaction between ligands and corresponding receptors !!!REF!!!. In embryonic ventral mesencephalic dissociated cultures, recombinant human GDNF has been shown to promote the survival, increase the high-affinity dopamine uptake and stimulate the morphological complexity of dopaminergic neurons !!!REFs!!!. Similar survival promoting effects have been shown for NRTN !!!REFs!!!, ARTN !!!REF!!! and PSPN !!!REF!!!, as well as a neuritogenic effect for PSPN !!!REF!!!. In organotypic free-floating roller-tube (FFRT) cultures, a similar survival promoting effect has been observed on dopaminergic neurons after GDNF treatment !!!REF!!!. The effects of GFLs on survival, differentiation and function of cultured dopaminergic neurons suggest that they play a physiological role in the development of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in vivo !!!REF!!!. RET expression has been observed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons !!!REF!!! and all GFRαs, which can also work in a soluble form, in trans, are expressed within or in the vicinity of the substantia nigra !!!REFs!!!. The neuroprotective and the potential neuroregenerative effects of GFLs observed on dopaminergic neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have strongly suggested that GFLs are also potential candidates for the treatment of PD. A recent clinical trial providing evidence that direct infusion of GDNF into the putamen of PD patients is an effective treatment strategy supports this notion !!!REF!!!. Numerous studies of GFL signaling have been performed using cell lines, but the mode of action in primary cells needs further investigations. In the present study, we performed a detailed comparative dose–response analysis of the effects of GFLs on survival and morphological differentiation of TH-ir neurons in primary cultures of ventral mesencephalon.  For more than 20 years, intracerebral transplantation of embryonic ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue, rich in dopamine (DA) neurons, has been looked upon as a particularly promising approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Hopes were fostered by the encouraging results produced by intrastriatal VM transplants both in animal models of PD !!!REFs!!! and in early open-label clinical trials !!!REFs!!!. In a majority of transplanted patients the grafts were found to survive and ameliorate many of the symptoms of PD and to reduce the need for L-dopa. In response to the promising early findings, two double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of human embryonic VM grafts to patients with PD were initiated. After unblinding of the first of these, the previous enthusiasm was severely set back by reports that a subgroup of patients developed a severe and persistent form of dyskinesia at late postoperative periods !!!REFs!!!. Other reports were soon to follow indicating that dyskinesias indeed can develop as a complication of intrastriatal VM grafting !!!REFs!!!. These dyskinesias are a puzzling phenomenon that has not been foreseen by experimental studies of VM transplantation in animal models.  Sleep seems to improve consolidation of procedural and declarative knowledge, defined as “know how” and episodic or semantic information, respectively !!!REF!!!. It has recently been hypothesized that this improvement derives from an off-line reprocessing of the traces of new information at different levels of memory organization !!!REFs!!!. This view has already received some support at a neurobiological level. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the specific brain regions involved in the acquisition of procedural skills are activated during subsequent periods of rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, rather than non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep, and that this re-activation is followed by better post-sleep performance !!!REFs!!!. At a behavioural level, pertinent insights may be gained from the study of delayed recall of dreams or, in more general terms, mental sleep experiences (MSEs). Indeed, subjects’ post-sleep associations regarding their MSEs indicate that nearly all the contents derive from the transformation of various kinds of declarative knowledge, such as recent and remote events, habits, and semantic knowledge !!!REFs!!!. MSE contents hardly ever reproduce recent events as a replay, but result from substantial active re-elaboration !!!REF!!!. And MSEs usually reach a certain level of consolidation during sleep, being accessible not only just after provoked awakening, but also after a fairly long delay, for example, on the following morning (for review, see !!!REF!!!). We have recently hypothesized that the processing which actively transforms given items of declarative knowledge into MSE contents can improve consolidation of the output as well as of the input (i.e., the items themselves) in a similar way to that involved in the so-called “generation effect” !!!REF!!!. For information elaborated in waking, this effect consists in better long-term retention for items which are actively elaborated in tasks such as solving anagrams, completing word fragments, translating from one language to another !!!REF!!!, compared with the items which are only acquired passively. Moreover, where strong associative relationships are formed between the sources and outcomes of performed tasks !!!REFs!!!, active processing appears to improve consolidation of the items in the input as well as in the output. Delayed recall of the so-called “interrelated contents”, which correspond to identical or similar contents occurring in two of more MSEs developed over the same night !!!REFs!!!, can provide some support for the hypothesis of a generation effect on the output of MSE processing. Interrelated contents are present in a substantial proportion (about 2/3) of pairs of reports collected after sequences of awakenings provoked during REM–REM, NREM–NREM and NREM–REM sleep (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Since interrelated contents share all or several semantic features, they are likely to derive from repeated access to, and elaboration of, the same items of declarative knowledge. It thus seems plausible to expect that, if the improvement of consolidation is somehow related to the amount of processing which given items undergo, interrelated contents should be better retained at delayed recall than non-interrelated ones. To test this hypothesis, in the present study we compared the frequencies of interrelated and non-interrelated contents in pairs of MSEs reported both at night and in the morning. MSEs were collected after awakenings provoked during the first four periods of REM sleep over each of two experimental nights. This test seemed reliable insofar as only a part of the contents reported at night are recalled in the morning, and they appear, on the basis of psycholinguistic indicators, better consolidated in memory than other contents !!!REFs!!!. At the same time, we evaluated whether the improved retention of interrelated contents is a parasitic effect of other factors, in particular (a) by-chance semantic features of interrelated contents, such as bizarreness, which has been shown to facilitate delayed recall !!!REF!!!; (b) report length, given that MSE reports obtained from the first REM period are usually shorter than those from the following periods !!!REFs!!! and (c) the length of the interval between immediate and delayed recall !!!REF!!!. We, therefore, compared the frequencies and retention rates of interrelated and non-interrelated contents in report pairs of MSEs (a) of the same and different subjects; (b) with and without the MSE collected after awakening in the first period of REM sleep and (c) with varying intervals between immediate and delayed recall of earlier and later MSEs paired.  An important contribution to the symptomatic treatment of migraine has been brought about by serotonin (5HT)1B/1D receptor agonists of the first- and second-generation, known as triptans !!!REFs!!!. Such drugs show a certain selectivity towards both the vasoconstrictor 5HT1B receptors situated in the smooth muscle of meningeal blood vessels and the pre-junctional 5HT1D receptors involved in the neurogenic inflammation and central cerebral transmission of pain !!!REFs!!!. Because of the potential vasoconstricting action of triptans also in cerebral and coronary arteries !!!REF!!! as documented in vitro, the contraindication for the use of such molecular entities in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors still stands !!!REFs!!!. A haemodynamic effect of first the generation triptan, sumatriptan, has been documented by means of transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies; blood flow velocity (BFV) changes, indicating vasoconstriction in the main cerebral arteries of patients during migraine attack treated with sumatriptan have been detected by most studies !!!REFs!!!, however Diener et al. !!!REF!!! failed to find any change in BFV in middle cerebral artery after sumatriptan administration, both in migraine-attack period and headache-free period. The high efficacy profile of sumatriptan as well as some of its shortcomings (low oral bioavailability, high headache recurrence and chest symptoms) have prompted the development of several second-generation triptans, including rizatriptan (RZT). In animal models, RZT induces vasoconstriction of isolated dural and cerebral arteries !!!REFs!!! and inhibits the release of sensory neuropeptides from perivascular trigeminal nerves to prevent neurogenic vasodilation and extravasation in the dura mater !!!REF!!!. In humans, vasoconstrictor and neural effects, central and peripheral, have been proposed as mechanisms by which RZT relieves headache !!!REF!!!. Even if, according to findings from several studies, rizatriptan may be expected to cause highly selective vasoconstriction within intracranial extracerebral vessels (i.e., meningeal arteries), no literature data are available to date on possible cerebral hemodynamic changes in humans after rizatriptan treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of RZT on cerebral BFV performing TCD monitoring during spontaneous attack of migraine without aura.  A number of pregnane steroids have been show to elicit a pharmacological spectrum of action that is shared by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. With increasing doses, these compounds reliably elicit anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, ataxic, and hypnotic effects. Progesterone is an ovarian hormone that has been found to elicit many of these effects. In turn, the effects of progesterone have been attributed to the formation of its reduced metabolite, 3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone), a potent positive modulator of the GABAA receptor !!!REFs!!!. Allopregnanolone is one of a number of neurosteroids synthesized in brain de novo from cholesterol as a result of stimulation of a benzodiazepine receptor located on mitochondrial membranes of glial cells !!!REFs!!!. Another source of allopregnanolone is from the metabolism of progesterone secreted from the ovaries and adrenal glands. In addition to the similarity in acute drug effects, withdrawal from allopregnanolone exposure produces responses that are similar to those seen after termination from chronic treatment with benzodiazepines or alcohol. For example, discontinuation of exogenous progesterone administration in the rat elicited an anxiogenic-like response !!!REF!!!, and treatment of progesterone-dependent rats with finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor that prevents the formation of allopregnanolone from progesterone, was shown to have a pro-convulsant effect !!!REFs!!!. Progesterone withdrawal decreased the anxiolytic-like and sedative effects of benzodiazepines !!!REFs!!!, and also eliminated the benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of GABA-stimulated chloride currents in dissociated hippocampal neurons !!!REFs!!!. The purpose of this study was to determine if an endogenous elevation in ovarian hormone levels would elicit changes in GABAA receptor function. Thus, we studied the effects of pseudopregnancy on behavior in the elevated plus-maze, on benzodiazepine binding, and on GABA-stimulated Cl− influx response in vitro. We hypothesized that pseudopregnancy ought to be associated with a desensitization of the GABAA receptor, thus reflecting a pharmacodynamic tolerance that results from prolonged exposure to the GABAergic neurosteroid. In addition, we examined the effects of pseudopregnancy termination in order to test the hypothesis that a precipitous loss of ovarian steroids would trigger a withdrawal syndrome reflecting the pharmacodynamic changes that occurred in response to the persistent elevated ovarian steroid levels.  Postmortem examinations of the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show characteristic structures termed amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid plaques are composed of various peptide fragments of β-amyloid (Aβ). There is substantial evidence that amyloid derived peptides consisting of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides are neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, many substances are in development, which reduce the production of β-amyloid or protect neuronal cells from the toxicity of amyloid fibers. Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter involved in cognition. According to the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic neurons are extremely vulnerable and become dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease !!!REFs!!!. This has been the basis of the development of cholinomimetic drugs over the last 10 years, of which tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are currently approved for treatment. Acetylcholine receptors in the brain include the muscarinic receptors (mAChR) and the nicotinic receptors (nAChR). AChE inhibitors, through their blockade of the enzyme responsible for ACh breakdown, activate both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in synchrony with presynaptic action potentials, which is fundamentally different from a continuous agonistic stimulation. Muscarinic receptor stimulation has been shown to have beneficial effects on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, tau hyperphosphorylation and cell survival, probably through a phospholipase-C mediated G-protein coupled receptor pathway (for a recent review see !!!REF!!!). In fact, in a clinical trial with talsaclidine, a partial M1 agonist, 4 weeks treatment significantly reduced Aβ1–42 levels in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), while stabilizing Aβ1–40 levels !!!REF!!!. Recent research suggests that neurotoxicity of the Aβ peptides occurs via their interaction with the α7 nicotinic ACh receptors rather than with α4β2 !!!REFs!!!. These studies suggest that basal activation of the α7 nAChR is necessary for cell survival and that Aβ peptides inhibit this receptor activation, causing cellular stress and subsequent cell death. There is also indirect evidence for a link between activation of nicotinic receptors and reduced Aβ formation. In postmortem studies of controls and AD patients, much less Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 and a higher level of preserved nicotinic receptors have been found in the brain of smokers !!!REF!!!. This is in line with a study of transgenic mice (Tg(Hu.APP695.K670N-M671L)2576) in which chronic nicotinic treatment for 5.5 months significantly reduced amyloid plaque deposition !!!REF!!!. Earlier case-control or retrospective studies had indicated a protective effect of smoking against Alzheimer's disease; in contrast, prospective studies found a greater risk of dementia in smokers (for a recent review see !!!REF!!!). This issue is still under debate although cardiovascular disease, which is increased in smokers, does appear to be a risk factor for developing AD. These data clearly suggest that the new generation of AChE-Is, by stimulating both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, especially through the α7 nAChR, have a substantial neuroprotective effect. As galantamine additionally allosterically stimulates the α7 nAChR, it is expected that this compound has a prominent neuroprotective profile. This will be reviewed in the next section.  In recent years, there has been growing empirical support for the notion that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are modulated during times of stress. Generally speaking, however, the direction and magnitude of cytokine changes in response to stress varies remarkably depending upon a variety of factors including (a) whether one examines cytokine production in the presence or absence of inflammatory challenge, (b) the techniques employed for measuring changes in the particular cytokine (bioassay, ELISA, RT-PCR, etc.), (c) the physical compartment where the cytokine is measured, (d) the time of sample collection relative to stressor onset/termination, and (e) the physical characteristics of the stressor that is employed as the principal modulating agent. While such a diverse array of findings has been fruitful for our understanding of basic processes involved in stress-induced immunomodulation, there are cases where methodological inconsistencies have made it difficult to develop a clear theoretical construct to explain existing data collected across multiple laboratories. One case in point is with regards to central IL-1 responses to stress. It has been well documented now that exposure to certain acute stressors – in the absence of concurrent immunological challenge – can potently increase the expression of IL-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), and that the hypothalamus is a principal site where such changes are observed. The hypothalamus expresses receptors for IL-1 !!!REF!!!, and IL-1 transmission in the hypothalamus appears to be involved in coordinating the expression of multiple sickness responses during times of infection (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). It stands to reason, then, that if exposure to psychological stressors is capable of increasing IL-1 expression (and presumably IL-1 activity), then some of the long-term behavioral adaptations incurred by stressors might appropriately be viewed as “stress-induced sickness behaviors” (see !!!REF!!! for an overview of this hypothesis). Indeed, there is accumulating evidence that behavioral responses to at least some stressors can be blocked by agents with potent anti-inflammatory properties such as IL-1 receptor antagonist !!!REFs!!!, α-MSH !!!REF!!!, and indomethacin !!!REF!!!. However, since only some stressors induce hypothalamic expression of IL-1 !!!REFs!!! and anti-inflammatory agents do not block all behavioral responses to stress (e.g., !!!REF!!!), it is of great interest to explore the characteristics of a stressor which are necessary for the observation of stress-induced increases in hypothalamic IL-1. Some information regarding the characteristics of a stressor that engender stress-induced increases in hypothalamic IL-1 can be gleaned from stressors that have already been examined (see !!!REF!!! for a summary of these findings). Initial reports by Shintani et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated robust increases in hypothalamic IL-1 during immobilization stress as measured by bioassay. Later reports from the same group showed that this effect was likely to include de novo synthesis of IL-1 protein, since mRNA for IL-1 was significantly elevated by the same treatment !!!REF!!!. Similar increases in hypothalamic IL-1 were reported following inescapable tailshock using a tissue homogenization preparation and a sandwich ELISA detection system, an effect which was augmented by adrenalectomy !!!REFs!!!. Although there had been reports of increased circulating cytokines in response to open field stress prior to this !!!REF!!!, these were the first reports of stress-induced increases in hypothalamic IL-1. Since then, similar effects have been reported following inescapable tailshock at the level of mRNA using semi-quantitative RT-PCR !!!REF!!! and at the level of IL-1 protein following a similar regimen of footshock !!!REF!!!. Thus, the data to-date suggest that immobilization and shock paradigms appear to be especially capable of driving central IL-1 responses to stress. However, given disagreements in the literature regarding the ability of non-pathogenic stressors to induce IL-1 expression in the CNS, we performed – using identical dissection and IL-1 measurement techniques in our own laboratory – a systematic series of experiments to evaluate the impact of multiple distinct stressors on hypothalamic IL-1 levels. At the same time, it was deemed necessary to evaluate the specificity of our IL-1 detection method. To do this, we examined (a) whether the capture antibody employed in the IL-1 ELISA would detect immunopositive bands at the approximate molecular weight of IL-1, (b) if immunopositive banding at this molecular weight would be increased by peripheral immune challenge, and (c) whether IL-1 transcript in the hypothalamus would be upregulated following footshock (a stressor known to increase hypothalamic IL-1 protein levels) or immune activation.  Among other noninvasive brain-mapping techniques (MRI, fMRI, PET, and MEG/EEG), the old-fashioned electroencephalogram (EEG) may provide enough information for the proper diagnosis of many neurological diseases and to establish brain–behaviour relationships. Here we present an EEG study on adrenergic modulation of absence epilepsy using a genetic model, the WAG/Rij strain of rats !!!REFs!!!. Several intrinsic anti-epileptic mechanisms can normally safeguard the brain against paroxysmal activity. The central noradrenergic system is among them. On the synaptic level noradrenaline (NA) adjusts a balance between excitation and inhibition, this impedes neurons to enter a hyperexcitatory state, therefore the probability of absence seizures diminishes for review on anti-epileptic activity of NA (see Refs. !!!REFs!!!). Neuromodulatory effect of NA is mediated by several classes and subclasses of adrenoreceptors (AR): alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3 !!!REFs!!!. Unlike beta, alpha-adrenergic mechanisms govern epilepsy, for instance, absence seizures are reduced by the administration of alpha-1 agonists and alpha-2 antagonists but aggravated by alpha-2 agonists !!!REFs!!!. There is a dual definition of alpha-1 and alpha-2 AR (for review see Refs. !!!REFs!!!). The first classification regards the localization of AR, it assumes that alpha-1 AR are present on post-synaptic membranes, alpha-2 AR are pre-synaptic !!!REFs!!!. The second classification is based upon pharmacological characteristics of AR, i.e., pre- and post-synaptic AR exhibit distinct selectivity profiles !!!REF!!!. Activation of alpha-2 AR on dendrites and soma of noradrenergic neurons of the (autoreceptors) reduces firing of noradrenergic neurons that inhibit NA release !!!REFs!!!. Alpha-2 AR is also present on terminals of other neuromodulatory neurons (heteroreceptors) such as dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons !!!REFs!!!. These receptors are 10 times less sensitive to clonidine than autoreceptors !!!REF!!!. Historically, clonidine is used as a selective agonist of alpha-2 AR !!!REFs!!!. Since almost all brain structures receive NA-containing terminals from the !!!REFs!!!, peripheral administration of clonidine reduces noradrenergic neurotransmission throughout the entire brain. In particular, weakening of the ascending adrenergic innervation may facilitate bursting activity of the thalamo-cortical neurons !!!REFs!!! and reinforce oscillatory activity in the thalamo-cortical loop (relay nuclei in the thalamus, the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and the neocortex !!!REFs!!!). In such an indirect way clonidine may promote spike-wave discharges (SWD). Clonidine is unable to provoke SWD de novo in non-epileptic animals !!!REF!!!. As known, some rat strains with absence epilepsy have a congenital deficit of aminergic system !!!REFs!!! that might be necessary for clonidine to have a pro-absence effect. Why clonidine can intensify absence seizures is still uncertain. Buzsaki et al. !!!REF!!! collected some evidence showing that clonidine might act on pre-synaptic and post-synaptic alpha-2 AR in order to promote SWD. Here we examine the hypothesis that the thalamus is specifically involved in the SWD-promoting effect of clonidine. The amplitude–frequency characteristics of electrical activity in the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM) and in the RTN will be measured. Epidural EEG electrodes are used to record frontal and occipital EEG. By means of spectral and coherence analysis we will examine what part of the thalamo-cortical loop may particularly be involved in the clonidine-induced aggravation of SWD in WAG/Rij rats. Clonidine aggravates absence epilepsy in a dose-dependent manner !!!REFs!!!. High doses of the drug (higher than 0.1mg/kg) can also intensify some side effects (decrease of temperature, heart and respiratory rates, salivation etc. !!!REF!!!) and result to dissociation between EEG and behavioural activities. In concentration of 0.02mg/kg clonidine enhances electroencephalographic seizures (SWD), however, it disturbs the normal relation between EEG and behaviour !!!REF!!!: ictal periods may suddenly be interrupted by brief episodes of slow-wave EEG; interictal activity may be typical for sleep, but animals might be awake (our unpublished data). Here we will use clonidine in the very low dosage of 0.00625mg/kg: it is enough to inhibit NA release via pre-synatic mechanisms !!!REFs!!! and to enhance SWD in WAG/Rij rats !!!REF!!!, yet it is insufficient to influence other neuromodulatory systems via heteroreceptors !!!REF!!! or to destroy the usual pattern of EEG and behaviour !!!REFs!!!. Previously we reported on a difference between two types of SWD in respect to their topographic distribution and sensitivity to clonidine: generalized SWD (type I) were aggravated with clonidine, but local occipital discharges (SWD II) were unaffected !!!REF!!!. Probably, SWD II are invulnerable to clonidine and is refrained from noradrenergic control. Here the dynamics of SWD I and SWD II after i.p. injection of clonidine was studied in more detail. The administration of clonidine in a low dose results in electroencephalographic and behavioural sedation !!!REFs!!!, apparently associated with the reduction of noradrenergic neurotransmission. Low-vigilance and transitory states are favourable for the occurrence of SWD !!!REFs!!!; therefore clonidine-induced sedation may indirectly influence SWD. Here changes in vigilance states after clonidine were examined in relation to the incidence of SWD. Clonidine may also influence the interictal EEG; the probable changes in background EEG may also facilitate the appearance of SWD. The present study examines whether clonidine will induce the same changes of EEG power during ictal (SWD) and interictal (normal sleep) EEG and interprets these data in respect to the seizure-aggravating activity of clonidine.  In mammalian brain, taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids !!!REF!!!. In central neural system, its physiological actions are considered essential in development !!!REF!!!, osmoregulation !!!REF!!! and neurotransmission !!!REF!!!. Recently, Galarreta et al. !!!REF!!! have reported that taurine application generates a long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic potentials in the hippocampus, which is independent of GABAA and NMDA receptor activation. On the basis of its novel capability, taurine could be proposed as a retrograde factor involved in LTP maintenance !!!REF!!!. Persistent changes in the hippocampal synaptic strength seem to be especially relevant phenomena accounting for the cellular basis of learning and memory !!!REF!!!. Although the previous study !!!REF!!! has shown that LTP and LTP occlude mutually and therefore may share some mechanisms involved in LTP, LTP has some unusual properties, such as the lack of pathway specificity, the dependence on low-voltage activated calcium channels (LVACC) and taurine uptake system. Moreover, unlike LTP , LTP is a not only postsynaptic but also presynaptic phenomenon. As a well-known environmental toxicant, lead has been concerned for its severe impairment on the cognitive function in children !!!REF!!!. A great deal of studies reported that chronic developmental lead exposure raises the threshold for and impairs the induction of LTP of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in rat hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. And, it has also been suggested that the inhibition of LTP is due to the NMDA receptor and voltage-sensitive calcium channels being blocked by lead !!!REFs!!!. Since LTP differs from LTP in the dependence on NMDA receptor and calcium channels, we wonder whether lead exposure has different effects on LTP . In order to provide evidence of the hypothesis, we examined the effects of chronic lead exposure on LTP and compared them with those on LTP .  The trigeminal spinal nucleus is an important relay station in the transmission of orofacial sensory information, and this nucleus is functionally and anatomically subdivided into three nuclei from the rostral to the caudal: oralis, interpolaris, and caudalis !!!REFs!!!. Among them the nucleus oralis conveys information for the nociceptive reflex, e.g., the jaw-opening reflex (JOR) from the orofacial region, including tooth-pulp (TP) !!!REFs!!!. The JOR is a masticatory reflex !!!REF!!!, and the TP-evoked JOR has been considered a pain induced response model if it is evoked by adequate TP stimulation. The majority of sensory neurons in the JOR arc are located in the trigeminal spinal nucleus oralis (TSNO) !!!REF!!!, which projects to the trigeminal motor nucleus of the digastric muscle !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, it has been reported that the TP-evoked JOR is depressed by sensory inputs arising elsewhere on the body. For example, electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve inhibits the JOR evoked by TP stimulation in a certain conditioning-test (C-T) paradigm and this inhibition may be mediated by neural pathways involving the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and/or nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) !!!REF!!!. The TP-evoked JOR is known to be inhibited by antinociception pathways mediated by the PAG and/or NRM !!!REFs!!! as well as by analgesic drugs !!!REF!!!. It is well known that stimulation of the PAG and NRM inhibits the activity of neurons in both the spinal cord and the trigeminal complex !!!REFs!!!. In particular, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that terminals of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons were observed in the spinal cord as well as in the trigeminal complex originating from in the brainstem nuclei, and that activation of descending serotonergic pathways induced by electrical stimulation of NRM !!!REFs!!! inhibits spinal transmission of nociceptive information. Concerning 5-HT receptors related to the spinal antinociception, different binding sites such as 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors have been implicated in the analgesic effect of 5-HT !!!REFs!!!. In the TP-evoked pain transmission, Tanimoto et al. !!!REF!!! reported that TP-evoked C1 spinal neurons were inhibited by conditioning stimulation of vagal afferents and this inhibitory effect was attenuated by intravenous administration of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ICS 205-930, in rats. In addition, Yonehara !!!REF!!! found that TP stimulation evoked substance P release in the trigeminal spinal nucleus caudalis (TSNC) was decreased by electro-acupuncture and this decrease was antagonized by intravenous administration of ICS 205-930 in rabbits. These reports indicated the possibility that the descending serotonergic system related to 5-HT3 receptors acts to inhibit TP-evoked nociceptive transmission. Furthermore, in the spinal cord, iontophoretic application of γ-aminobutyric-acid type A (GABAA) receptor antagonists blocks the inhibitory action of a 5-HT3 receptor agonist applied iontophoretically !!!REF!!!. This probably implies that endogenously released 5-HT in the spinal cord can activate inhibitory interneurons, which in turn promote the release of GABA. Cropper et al. !!!REF!!! reported that 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers were found in the TSNO. In addition, there is evidence that 5-HT3 receptor-immunoreactive neurons were broadly distributed throughout the rat brain and spinal cord, possibly including the trigeminal spinal nucleus !!!REF!!!. These results lead us to suggest that excitation of the 5-HT3 receptors located in the TSNO may activate the descending serotonergic inhibitory system through inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Thus the question arises as to whether the descending serotonergic inhibitory pathways activated by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve (SN) modify the activity of TSNO neurons responding to TP stimulation in rats, but there are no studies examining such an interaction. It has been reported that microiontophoretic method using multibarrel microelectrodes is an effective clue to analyse the local neural circuit !!!REF!!!. By using two different applications (intravenous and iontophoretic applications) of drugs, we can determine how the drug acts TSNO neurons. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the responses of TP-evoked TSNO neuronal activity to SN stimulation before and after intravenous administration of ICS 205-930 as well as before and after local iontophoretic application of ICS 205-930 or bicuculline in the TSNO. Furthermore, we also examined whether the 5-HT3 receptor expresses in the TSNO with immunohistochemical technique.  In addition to the dominant, and tonic inhibitory influence of the hypothalamus !!!REF!!! growing body of evidence showing the involvement of prolactin (PRL)-releasing factors in the regulation of PRL secretion derived from the neuro-intermediate lobe (NIL) of the pituitary gland !!!REFs!!!. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), a dopamine (DA) related tetrahydroisoquinoline, ()-salsolinol (SAL), has been recently found to be present in the perchloric acid extracts of NIL and median eminence (ME) obtained from male as well as intact-, and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, analysis of SAL concentrations in NIL revealed parallel increases with plasma PRL in lactating rats exposed to a brief (15min) suckling stimulus following 4-h separation !!!REFs!!!. SAL was without effect on the secretion of other pituitary hormones, therefore, SAL seems to be a selective and potent stimulator of PRL secretion in vivo !!!REFs!!!. We have also found that SAL can elevate PRL release, though to a lesser extent, in pituitary cell cultures as well as in freely moving hypophysectomized rats bearing anterior lobe (AL) under the kidney capsule !!!REF!!!. The lack of interference of SAL with [3H]-spiperone binding to membranes prepared from the AL indicates that SAL does not act at the D2 DA receptor !!!REF!!!. Moreover, [3H]-SAL binds specifically to homogenate of AL as well as NIL obtained from lactating rats !!!REF!!!. In our most recent studies it has been found that a structural analogue of SAL, 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (1MeDIQ), besides its inhibitory effect on PRL response induced by SAL, it can also block suckling-, immobilization stress-, and formalin stress-induced PRL release !!!REFs!!!. Taken together, these data clearly suggest that if SAL can really be synthesized in situ, it can play a role in the regulation of pituitary PRL secretion. Previous observations have also suggested that vasopressin (VP) released from the neural lobe (NL) of the pituitary gland is essential for the normal secretory responses of PRL during lactation !!!REFs!!!. In agreement with these, several other experimental findings !!!REFs!!! have clearly demonstrated that disturbances in the water and electrolyte balance of the animal can profoundly alter PRL secretion in lactating mothers !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, in addition to monitor plasma PRL concentrations following SAL injection, we have also measured plasma levels of VP prior to, and following SAL administration in both intact and dehydrated animals. Cyclic 3′5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important intracellular second messenger molecule regulating different cell functions through activation of protein kinase A enzyme !!!REF!!!. It is well known that cAMP plays an important role in synthesis and release of pituitary hormones including both PRL and VP from lactotropes, and hypothalamic magnocellular neurons, respectively !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, when the cAMP of the NL, intermediate lobe (IL) and AL has been measured during suckling-stimulus, 10-min suckling induced a significant increase of cAMP concentration in the AL !!!REF!!!. At the same time, changes in cAMP of different regions of the central nervous system have been already detected following injection of several tetrahydroisoquinolines including SAL !!!REFs!!!. Based on all of these findings, we were interested to see the effect of SAL on the concentration of cAMP production in the ME, AL and NIL, and whether there are any changes in the plasma concentrations of VP following SAL injection in lactating mothers.  The neurotoxicity of exogenous dopamine (DA) has been described in vivo, in primary cultures and in several cell lines !!!REFs!!!. Many studies indicate that an imbalance between cytoplasmic and vesicular DA may lead to oxidative stress and cell degeneration !!!REF!!!. This imbalance may underlie the dopaminergic degeneration observed in neurological diseases such as Parkinsonism. Dopamine may cause apoptosis !!!REF!!!, but most studies on DA toxicity agree that non-apoptotic mechanisms are also involved in DA-induced cell death !!!REFs!!!. Extracellular concentrations of 100–500μM DA induce autophagy and cell death in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells !!!REF!!!, and the activation of the stress-response MAPKs, p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK. In addition, this range of DA concentrations increases expression of α-synuclein, the main protein in Lewy body inclusions in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders !!!REF!!!. α-Synuclein is increased in neuroblastoma cells treated with MPP+ or DA !!!REFs!!! and in mice, after MPTP treatment !!!REF!!! and after chronic inhibition of mitochondrial activity !!!REF!!!. However, DA does not dramatically alter mitochondrial activity !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the overexpression of the mutant form of α-synuclein, A53T, described in a familial form of Parkinsonism, induces autophagic cell death !!!REF!!!. Autophagy occurs in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease !!!REF!!!, but few studies have addressed autophagy in dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. We used a proteomic array system to identify proteins induced by DA in SH-SY5Y cells. We first focused on the transcription factor GADD153 (growth arrest DNA damage-inducible 153 protein). Related to this factor (also called C/EBP homology protein—CHOP), we studied C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), since the promoter region of the α-synuclein gene contains distinct boxes for C/EBPβ transcription factor interaction !!!REF!!!, and expression of one of these factors is often associated to expression of the other !!!REFs!!!. The C/EBP family of transcription factors is involved in the regulation of the growth and differentiation of several cell types !!!REF!!!. C/EBPβ has highly conserved DNA binding domains and C/EBPβ and GADD153/CHOP have leucine zipper dimerization domains at the carboxyl terminus, therefore, they can act as heterodimers C/EBPβ-GADD153 !!!REFs!!!. GADD153 expression, studied with cDNA arrays, increases in neuroblastoma cells after DA !!!REF!!! and after MPP+ treatment !!!REF!!!. The expression of this factor increases after endoplasmic reticulum stress and is involved in unfolded reticular response (UPR) !!!REFs!!!. Here we report that the expression of GADD153 and C/EBPβ is increased in neuroblastoma cells exposed to DA.  Neurodegenerative disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases that normally strike late in life, often with devastating consequences for the affected individuals and their families. Parkinson's disease, for example, results in a decline in physical abilities, manifesting as resting tremors, rigidity, a decrease in the rapidity and amplitude of movements, difficulty initiating new movements, and postural instability !!!REFs!!!. Disorders such as Huntington's disease inflict psychiatric disturbances and bring about increasing difficulties performing cognitive tasks !!!REFs!!!. The economic toll resulting from neurodegenerative diseases is remarkable. As of 1997 the direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease were estimated to be on the order of $70 billion dollars (1991 currency) per year in the United States alone !!!REFs!!!. These burdens will increase as the North American population ages. The characterization of the genetic and environmental factors that cause neurodegeneration (ND) has progressed significantly in recent years. This success is exemplified by the pace at which the genes responsible for inherited blindness have been identified. Approximately 150 genetic loci associated with diseases of the retina are known, and the genes for roughly 100 of them have been isolated (RetNet, , and !!!REF!!!). Identification of such primary causes of ND, and the subsequent development of in vivo and in vitro methods designed to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which the disease symptoms arise, indicate that the underlying neuronal attrition involves programmed cell death !!!REFs!!!. The mechanisms responsible for initiating the cell death process are, however, still poorly understood. For example, mutations that result in photoreceptor degeneration are found in genes encoding proteins that function as signal transduction molecules, transcription factors, and structural proteins !!!REF!!!. This diversity of potential effectors has led to a range of proposals about the actual mechanisms of neuronal cell death initiation, including oxidative damage !!!REF!!!, accumulation of nuclear or cytoplasmic protein aggregates !!!REF!!!, or disruption of calcium homeostasis !!!REF!!!. An important trait of ND is the kinetics by which cells are lost from the affected population: if normal function requires certain minimal numbers and configurations of neurons in specific pathways and circuits, then the ND kinetics establishes the time scales over which cell attrition eradicates the function and identifies the intervals during which loss is greatest. To date, this feature has received less attention than have biochemical and genomic characterization. Recently, we demonstrated that the kinetics of cell loss in many forms of both inherited and acquired neurodegeneration can be accurately described as a one-hit process in which the risk of cell death is constant !!!REF!!!. To account for this observation we postulated the existence of an alternative cellular state, the mutant steady state (MSS), in which the affected cells are viable but have an increased risk of undergoing cell death compared to normal cells !!!REFs!!!. This risk of death to cells in the normal state is sufficiently low as to have no impact on the pattern of cell attrition over time. The simplest case for degenerating cell populations is that in which all cells in the MSS share the same risk value. Such population-wide uniformity of death risk is, however, a restrictive assumption. Variations in extra- and intracellular microenvironments, resulting from differences between cell types within an affected tissue, from deviations in the subcellular characteristics of cells of the same type, from exposure to different levels of diffusible factors, or from some combination thereof are likely to cause the risk to vary from cell to cell. In this paper we develop and apply a generalized one-hit model of ND that accommodates inter-neuron differences in death risk. We find that this approach yields better fits to ND data compared to homogeneous MSS risk models and leads to the first quantitative description of the heterogeneity of cell loss kinetics. Population models based on Gaussian or normal distributions of the death risk value among affected neurons are eliminated in all but one case; instead, we recover risk heterogeneities distributed with marked positive skew and leptokurtic central tendencies, which are assessed quantitatively. We conclude that all the ND cases for which we have kinetic data can be described by relatively few patterns in the death risk distributions, and may therefore, share common kinetic mechanisms at the level of individual cell dropout. Thus, our study provides the first measures of death kinetic heterogeneity in neuronal populations that are consistent with one-hit attrition in a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders.  Most studies addressing the neural substrate of egocentric orientation and egocentrically based problem solving by rats in water mazes (e.g., !!!REFs!!!) have utilized procedures in which the swimming animal is allowed to view the distal cues of the experimental room. The rat is, however, prevented from utilizing such cues for navigational purposes by a procedure in which the platform constantly changes its position relative to the distal cues—while remaining in a fixed position relative to the start position of a given trial. Such a procedure precludes proficient task solution based on allocentric methods of spatial orientation. Consequently, the animal is forced to utilize egocentric orientation in order to solve the task. One should, however (as pointed out elsewhere !!!REF!!!) be aware that the experimental setup in these studies may invite a competition between the application of allocentric and egocentric solution strategies. Therefore, proficient task solution may depend critically on structures involved in the mediation of selection of and shifts between behavioural strategies. Additionally, the activity of structures primarily involved in the mediation of allocentric spatial orientation may influence the quality of task performance negatively. A more “pure” test of egocentric spatial orientation can be obtained in the absence of distal cues—e.g., when access to such cues is eliminated by a curtain spanning the circumference of the maze !!!REF!!!. The prefrontal cortex of the rat appears to play a significant role in mediation of the acquisition of spatial tasks requiring egocentric orientation in water mazes. This has been demonstrated utilizing both the procedure allowing a free view of distal cues while preventing navigation based on such cues !!!REFs!!! and utilizing a procedure eliminating the availability of distal cues altogether !!!REF!!!. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that with the latter procedure lesions of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex of the rat also impairs the retention of a preoperatively acquired task requiring egocentric orientation !!!REF!!!. These results agree well with the model proposed by Poucet !!!REF!!!—which suggests that the prefrontal cortex is primarily involved in the mediation of egocentric spatial orientation as opposed to more allocentric forms of orientation. Studies addressing allocentric spatial orientation of the mapping type (a type of allocentric place learning occurring when the experimental situation offers an abundance of three-dimensionally arranged distal cues) have generally speaking demonstrated a marginal or absent impairment of task acquisition after prefrontal lesions (e.g., !!!REFs!!!—see, however, !!!REFs!!!). Place learning based on allocentric orientation of the “non-mapping” type (a type of allocentric place learning occurring in experimental situations offering only a restricted number of distal cues arranged in a less three-dimensional manner than what is the case in the “standard” water maze setup) is more severely impaired by prefrontal cortical lesions !!!REF!!!. It might be speculated that instances in which more pronounced impairments of task acquisition have been observed under circumstances where allocentric orientation has been presumed to be of the mapping type may, in reality, be the consequence of experimental setups provoking a task solution by strategies of a “non-mapping” type (see further discussion in !!!REF!!!). Studies addressing the involvement of the hippocampus in allocentrically based place learning of the mapping type in water mazes (e.g., !!!REFs!!!) have consistently demonstrated lesions of the hippocampus to be associated with major impairments of task acquisition. When, however, allocentrically based place learning is performed under circumstances causing a “non-mapping” strategy to be applied, hippocampally lesioned animals acquire the task as proficiently as sham-operated controls !!!REF!!!. Rats with lesions of the hippocampus in the form of transection of the fimbria-fornix !!!REF!!! were rather unimpaired in acquisition of an egocentrically based spatial orientation task in a water maze when offered access to—irrelevant—distal cues. This pattern of results agrees with both the model of Poucet !!!REF!!! and other demonstrations that hippocampally lesioned or inactivated rats are more impaired in tasks requiring allocentric than egocentric spatial orientation (e.g., !!!REF!!!). As argued above and elsewhere !!!REF!!! situations in which the availability of distal cues may invite the application of (irrelevant) allocentrically based solution strategies are not optimal for studies of the neural substrate of egocentric spatial orientation. Consequently, the apparent lack of a hippocampal involvement in the mediation of egocentric spatial orientation in water mazes should be addressed under experimental circumstances preventing the animal from viewing distal cues. The present study addressed aspects of the neural substrate of rats’ egocentric navigation in water mazes by studying the acquisition of a task requiring egocentric spatial orientation under circumstances preventing the swimming animals from viewing any distal cues (utilizing a procedure similar to the one of Mogensen et al. !!!REF!!!). We studied rats with bilateral transections of the fimbria-fornix—thereby examining whether the unimpaired acquisition by such animals of the task of de Bruin et al. !!!REF!!! might be dependent on the availability of cues in inviting a competing allocentric solution strategy. We also examined two other lesion groups: one subjected to bilateral ablations of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and one in which bilateral transections of the fimbria-fornix were combined with bilateral ablations of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex. These groups were included for two reasons. Firstly, we wanted to be able to compare directly the task acquisition of hippocampally lesioned animals and animals subjected to prefrontal ablations (a lesion we based on our previous study utilizing the same experimental procedures !!!REF!!! predicted would cause a major lesion-associated impairment of task acquisition). Secondly, we wanted to address the issue whether the hippocampus contributes to the posttraumatic functional recovery of egocentric spatial orientation seen after ablations of the prefrontal cortex !!!REF!!!. And, in case an impairment should be seen after hippocampal lesions, whether or not the prefrontal cortex participates in the mediation of a potential functional recovery after such lesions. If either of the single lesion groups would be significantly impaired in the acquisition of this task but would subsequently reveal a complete or partial functional recovery, it would be of interest to see whether the “combined lesion” group would reveal the same level of functional recovery. It would, for instance, be of interest to compare the degree of functional recovery seen in the prefrontal lesion alone group to the potential functional recovery seen in the combined lesion group. A significantly smaller (or even absent) functional recovery in the combined lesion group would indicate that the hippocampus contributes significantly to the mediation of functional recovery of egocentric spatial orientation after prefrontal cortical lesions. In a previous study !!!REF!!! we also studied groups of rats subjected to either individual lesions of the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus—or a combination of the two lesions. In that study we addressed effects of such lesions on the acquisition of an allocentrically based place learning task of the mapping type. The combined lesion group of that study demonstrated the same level of functional recovery as the group subjected to hippocampal lesions only. Pharmacological and behavioural “challenges” did, however, indicate that normally the prefrontal cortex contributes to the functional recovery of this type of place learning after hippocampal lesions—but a neural substrate outside the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus is in the absence of both of these structures able to mediate a functional recovery of the same proficiency as that seen in hippocampally lesioned animals only. In the present study we decided to include behavioural challenges in the form of a no-platform test followed by two “reversals” of the platform positions.  The β-amyloid precursor proteins (APP) are at least 10 isoforms of integral transmembrane glycoproteins derived from various mRNAs by the alternative splicing of the APP gene. Three of the APP isoforms, APP770 (full-length APP), APP751 (minus exon 8) and APP695 (minus exons 7 and 8) are known to contain 39–43 residues peptides referred as β-amyloid protein or Aβ. Both APP751 and APP770 include a sequence of 56 amino acids (exon 7) showing a close similarity to the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors (KPI) and are often referred as KPI-containing APP (APP-KPI) !!!REF!!!. APP mRNAs are distributed in many different tissues within the body at all stages of life !!!REF!!!. APP695 mRNA is the most abundant form within the rat brain and APP-KPI mRNA predominate in peripheral tissues but are less than 10% of the brain APP mRNA !!!REF!!!. APP isoforms are expressed in a cell type-specific manner in the rat brain, with APP695 being the most abundant form found in neurons and APP-KPI found predominantly in astroglial cells !!!REF!!!. Kirazov et al. !!!REF!!! have reported that APP is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) from the early stages of development; APP695 protein and mRNA increase during synaptogenesis, in the processes of neurite outgrowth and cell targeting, and in the maintenance of the functional integrity of synapses in the mature brain. In addition, APP695 has been shown to enhance the proliferation of neural stem cells in culture !!!REF!!!. However, in all stages of development the concentration of APP-KPI mRNAs are lower in the brain as compared to peripheral organs and tissues !!!REF!!!. The APP gene has been the subject of numerous studies on neurodegenerative processes, specially Alzheimer's disease (AD) because the Aβ peptide derived from APPs is the principal component that accumulates extracellularly resulting in the senile plaques that characterize the disorder !!!REFs!!!. Plaques of Aβ have been demonstrated in several brain areas such as amygdala, hippocampus and neocortex and have been associated with APP-KPI isoforms !!!REFs!!!. In these areas, the senile plaques have been shown to be involved with multiple neurotransmitters systems such as substance P, somatostatin, acetylcholine and nitric oxide (NO) !!!REFs!!!. Nitric oxide is a non-conventional neurotransmitter, formed by nNOS and proposed to participate in physiological and pathological processes in the brain !!!REF!!!. Until recently, it was believed that deposition of Aβ was involved in the physiological and pathological responses of brains under various neurodegenerative conditions, but it has now been shown that Aβ is produced under normal circumstances in healthy cells in vitro !!!REFs!!! and is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy individuals !!!REFs!!!. Thus, a variety of functions have been attributed to original APP in neurons including to be involved with some of those neurotransmitters systems in the brain !!!REFs!!!. The amygdala is involved in a number of functions such as emotional and social behavior, stress, learning and memory, among others. The cells located in the basolateral nuclei projects to the hippocampus, prefrontal and entorhinal cortex, and may play a role in the developmental plasticity reported for several of these functions !!!REFs!!!. The amygdala is an established component of the neural circuitry mediating the endocrine response to stress. The levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in amygdala and paraventricular nucleus are increased by restraint stress !!!REF!!! and alterations in neurotransmitter systems including dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and NO in amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampal formation, cortical areas and nucleus accumbens are also induced by stress !!!REFs!!!. Forced restraint is an effective and a widely employed stress-inducing method. Different regimes of restraint can trigger specific response mechanisms, which can induce different levels of neuroplasticity !!!REFs!!!. For example, single (2 or 6h) or repeated (2h daily/7 days) restraint episodes can trigger response mechanisms without inducing neuronal injury. However, severe and repeated restraint (6h daily/21 days) induces atrophy of apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons in rats !!!REFs!!!. These hippocampal morphological changes also appear after 3 weeks exposure to stress levels of glucocorticoids !!!REF!!!. Investigation of gene expression has helped integrate a number of research fields in several ways !!!REF!!!. Hybridization studies of mRNA can link genetic with morphological and neurochemical approaches. The present study investigated the changes in APP695 and APP751/770 (APP-KPI) mRNAs expression in amygdala and hippocampus of the rat brain induced by acute or chronic restraint stress.  Testing the ability of human subjects to align the orientation of a visual line to the direction of gravity (the subjective vertical test) is a classical protocol used to investigate the multisensory processes involved in the perception of spatial orientation. There are many ways of manipulating visual, vestibular and/or somatosensory signals so that the subjective vertical (SV) substantially differ from the veridical direction of gravity (for a review, see !!!REF!!!). It was often assumed that any error in estimating the vertical was a consequence of the misperception of one's own body orientation in space (subjective body orientation, SBO). Thus, a clockwise tilt of SV would be the mirror image of a counter-clockwise illusion of body rotation. Although very intuitive, this hypothesis has been proven wrong by several studies that showed that SV and SBO could be differentially affected by a given pattern of stimulation !!!REFs!!!. For instance, Ito and Gresty !!!REFs!!! demonstrated that a slow pitch tilt of the body was markedly overestimated whereas the orientation of a visual object remained accurate. Conversely, patients with an unilateral vestibular disorder exhibited a significant tilt of SV toward the side of the lesion, but no response bias when their task was to indicate when they entered or left self-verticality (see !!!REF!!! for a review). On the basis of such a dissociation between SV and SBO, the idea of a single internal representation of gravity, used by all perceptual and motor systems, can be excluded. More plausible is that the central nervous system (CNS) elaborates various references of verticality in function of the task demands and of the available sensory information. Van Beuzekom and Van Gisbergen !!!REF!!! performed an extensive study of SV and SBO during passive tilts of the body in the frontal plane. All subjects showed a large rotation of SV in the direction of body tilt (A effect), whether SV was tested with the classical visual-line test or with an oculomotor paradigm relying on saccadic pointing. When asked to verbally report their sense of subjective body tilt, subjects committed an error in the opposite direction to SV, but of much smaller amplitude. Van Beuzekom et al. !!!REF!!! also demonstrated that SBO, but not SV, showed a clear improvement when body tilts were actively performed by the subjects, i.e. when additional signals such as efference copies and somatosensory inputs resulting from muscle effort were available. To explain those results, the authors proposed a model in which SV and SBO dissociation depends mainly on signal of non-vestibular origin. Indeed, both percepts would rely on a common representation of head orientation in space, elaborated from vestibular signals, but the nature of somatosensory information used for SV and SBO would be different. For the establishment of SV, tactile and proprioceptive cues would contribute to improve the perception of head orientation relative to gravity by complementing vestibular information. On the other hand, SBO may be more dependent than SV on information from graviceptors in the trunk !!!REFs!!!, efference copies and pressure cues from the skin. The overall objective of the present experiment was to further study the question of how sensory signals are combined for the perception of spatial orientation. In particular, we investigated the contribution of vestibular signals to the dissociation between SV and SBO by using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). GVS is achieved by applying direct current of moderate intensity between the mastoid processes, which increases (cathode) or decreases (anode) the spontaneous firing of the otholitic and semicurcular canal afferents !!!REF!!!. GVS is an artificial way of altering the vestibular information and acts on the perceptual and motor systems in a way that has not been completely understood !!!REF!!!. However, this technique provides controlled and reversible perturbations to vestibular signals, allowing one to probe their influence on perceptual and motor tasks. GVS have been shown to influence various sensorimotor functions, such as the control of eye movements !!!REFs!!!, posture !!!REFs!!!, walking !!!REFs!!! and reaching movements !!!REFs!!!. Some studies suggested that GVS at low current intensities (below 3mA) selectively activated otolithic functions, without semicircular canal response !!!REFs!!!. However, more recent studies brought contradictory evidence !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, in an in-depth and thorough examination of the neurophysiological and behavioral litterature, Fitzpatrick and Day !!!REF!!! concluded that postural responses to GVS originate from canal afferents and only one part of the uticular macula, the pars medialis. Studies of the effect of GVS on the perception of spatial orientation are scarce. Some studies demonstrated that subjects perceived the visual scene as tilted in the direction opposite to anodal stimulation when experiencing GVS. As a consequence, when instructed to indicate the visual vertical, subjects committed an error toward the anode !!!REFs!!!. Mars et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated that this effect was not specific to the visual modality: it was also observed in the haptic modality, when subjects had to set a hand-held rod to the vertical in complete darkness. This suggests that GVS influences central processes in charge of spatial orientation. This hypothesis is supported by neurophysiological studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging !!!REFs!!!. GVS activated cortical areas related to oculomotor control and vestibular functions, but also multisensory areas, such as the inferior parietal lobule. However, Mars et al. !!!REF!!! reported that the effect of GVS on SV was larger in the visual task than in the haptic task. This difference may be due to an unregistered torsion of the eyes. Indeed, Zink et al. !!!REFs!!! recorded ocular torsion induced by GVS while subjects performed vertical settings. Perceptual and oculomotor effects were in the same direction and both were linearly correlated with stimulus intensity, with ocular torsion being of smaller magnitude than the tilt of the visual vertical. In addition, Watson et al. !!!REF!!! reported ocular torsion on the order of the difference between visual and haptic settings observed by Mars et al. !!!REF!!!, with both studies using very similar conditions of stimulation. Thus, the effect of GVS on the visual vertical may be the consequence of a tilt of the central representation of gravity in addition to unregistered ocular torsion. Besides, illusions of self-tilt were reported when GVS was applied. In a standing posture, subjects usually experienced an illusion of body tilt in the direction of the cathode, although Fitzpatrick et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated that this illusion only appeared when head and trunk motion was restrained. The illusory tilt is usually a static body tilt. No study ever quantified it. It appears that the magnitude of the illusion is limited by somatosensory information, since Day and Cole !!!REF!!! showed that a continuous tilting movement (i.e. an illusion of vection) replaced the usually observed static tilt in a patient with severe loss of somatosensory afferents. Fitzpatrick at al. !!!REF!!! also reported some vection illusions when healthy subjects were stimulated while in a supine position (i.e. without somatosensory input arising from the maintenance of the upright stance). Previous studies that demonstrated a dissociation between SV and SBO consisted in tilting the body of the subjects relative to gravity. This generates concurrent vestibular and somatosensory stimulation. In the present experiment, using GVS will allow to establish if this dissociation appears for a selective stimulation of the vestibular afferences. If no dissociation occur in these conditions, the conclusion would be that vestibular information contributes to the computation of an unique head-in-space representation, used for the computation of SV and SBO. As a consequence, the previously observed dissociation would rely exclusively on somatosensory information. If, on the contrary, GVS yields a dissociation between SV and SBO, this would suggest that the dissociation depends on vestibular signals or on higher levels of multisensory integration. In order to test this hypothesis, seated subjects performed vertical settings by remotely controlling the orientation of a visual rod in the frontal plane during GVS. Subjects were also instructed to evaluate the orientation of the head and trunk relative to gravity and to report them when the effect of GVS had faded. In previous studies, SV and SBO were often assessed by different methods. While SV was most often measured with the classical luminous rod method, subjects indicated SBO with various methods, such as self-controlled body tilt or verbal reports expressing the magnitude of tilt on a clock scale. Here, the methods used to assess both percepts were identical: the luminous bar used by subjects to indicate SV was also used to estimate SBO. The only difference was that SV was assessed during GVS whereas SBO was necessarily indicated after a delay. The experiment also compared SV and SBO settings when the head of the subjects were either restrained or free to move. This variable was introduced in order to evaluate if head immobility is necessary for body tilt illusions to appear in seated subjects. In addition, the “head free” condition will allow to determine if the postural response of the head to GVS can be related to the effect on SV or SBO.  The effects of sensorimotor interactions on the synchronization of cortical neurons have been investigated during galvanic somatosensory stimulations concomitant with passive movements, cutaneous sensory stimulations, and the execution or mental simulation of hand movements !!!REFs!!!. These interactions have been found to result in a reduction of the global synchronization of cortical pyramidal neurons generating somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) or magnetic counterpart, as an effect of a decreased summation of post-synaptic potentials at the arrival of peripheral sensory input. Such a “desynchronization” of the cortical pyramidal neurons decreases the amplitude of the SEPs (“gating”). The gating effects observed in the mentioned studies would result from centrifugal and/or centripetal interfering influences at the level of sensorimotor cortex, brainstem, and spinal somatosensory relays !!!REFs!!!. An open issue is whether such sensorimotor interactions, when warned, are prepared by specific anticipatory processes. Where are these anticipatory processes localized? Do they increase or decrease the synchronization of the cortical neurons? The synchronization of cortical neurons accompanying anticipatory processes has been studied in humans during the expectancy of warned stimuli. It has been shown that the development of slow event-related potentials (ERPs) of negative polarity is supposed to denote effective–motivational cortical processes and preparatory sensorimotor processes !!!REFs!!!. When no motor response is required, anticipatory ERPs preceding warned stimuli are termed stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN). Conversely, these potentials are termed contingent negative variation (CNV) when a motor response is required !!!REFs!!!. The CNV also develops before stimuli triggering Go/NoGo tasks in which the motor response is required only after Go stimuli !!!REF!!!. Source localization of CNV has been mainly elucidated by intracerebral stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) technique showing that CNV preceding motor activity originates from a distributed neural network with both cortical and subcortical nodes !!!REFs!!!. On the whole, CNV and SPN express ongoing slow increment in the synchronization of post-synaptic neuronal activity hidden into electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, which enhances the efficiency of brain information processing and corresponding cognitive performance !!!REFs!!!. According to the mentioned CNV literature, the present high-resolution EEG study tested the hypothesis that the anticipatory processes for sensorimotor interactions, induced by concomitant somatosensory stimuli and sensorimotor demands (Go/NoGo task), increase the synchronization of cortical neurons as revealed by the amplitude of the CNV.  Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from the accumulation of beta amyloid (Aß) deposits around capillaries, small arteries, and arterioles in the brain and meninges, and represents a significant cause of morbidity among the elderly. The range of vascular pathology attributable to CAA includes reduced cerebral perfusion, cortical microinfarction, and leukoencephalopathy !!!REFs!!!. At autopsy about 40% of cases with CAA show classical cortical neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Aß-containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic degeneration, gliosis, and severe cortical and brain atrophy !!!REFs!!!. Findings from human studies suggest that CAA may accelerate the effects of mild AD-type neuropathology and promote the progression of early to severe dementia !!!REFs!!!. Electron microscopic studies in CAA, combined with double-immunostaining of Aß-containing vessels using vascular markers, confirmed the marked loss of smooth muscle in larger vessels and the absence or reduction of endothelium in capillary profiles !!!REFs!!!. Quantitative analyses confirm abundant Aß deposits in neocortical fields of vessels containing relatively thin arterial walls and significant clinicopathological correlations between CAA and dementia scores !!!REF!!!. Since Aß leakage from capillaries into surrounding cortical parenchyma most likely occurs upstream to the deposition of amyloid-containing plaques and neurodegeneration in AD, CAA may represent one of the earliest markers of AD. AD-type neuropathology associated with CAA is strongly linked to the deposition of Aß peptides !!!REFs!!!. Previous studies using double transgenic (dtg) mice that express familial AD mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) show extensive Aß deposition around 7 months of age in brain regions affected in AD !!!REF!!!. These findings were confirmed in a second line of dtg APP/PS1 mice in which CAA appears around months of age, coincident with behavioral disturbances (neophobia, aggression, impaired cognition), glutamate excitotoxicity, and decreased long-term potentiation !!!REFs!!!. Studies in single transgenic mouse models that overexpress the Swedish APP mutation and deposit Aß in cortical tissue have reported disturbances in normal patterns of vascular circulation, including impaired cerebrovascular responses and reduced blood flow !!!REFs!!!. Magnetic resonance angiography in single tg mice overexpressing mutant APP identified deficiencies in cerebral perfusion as a function of capillary deformation and loss !!!REF!!!. Regarding possible mechanisms for this pathology, Aß may compromise the ability of cerebral endothelial cells to produce vascular relaxing factors, impair the ability of cerebral blood vessels to maintain adequate flow during hypotension, and/or block increases in blood flow evoked by enhanced brain activity !!!REF!!!. Few studies have investigated whether the deposition of toxic Aß in transgenic mouse models of AD is associated with degenerative changes in microvasculature similar to those reported in aging and AD brains at autopsy. The current study used modern stereological approaches in conjunction with β-nicotinamide adenine di-nucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase histochemistry to assess vascular changes in white matter of dtg mice resulting from the expression of transgenic Aß peptides !!!REFs!!!. NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry provides a specific histochemical marker for the production of nitric oxide (NO) for endothelial cells of capillary vessels !!!REFs!!!. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a 150-kDa NADPH-dependent enzyme that is constitutively expressed on endothelium cells of microvasculature in brain, and is essential to systemic and/or local vascular integrity. Like inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is induced by cytokine-stimulated neuroinflammatory pathology !!!REF!!!, eNOS is competitively inhibited by the NADPH-diaphorase substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) !!!REF!!!. Experimental evidence indicates specific NADPH-diaphorase staining of angiogenic endothelial cells !!!REF!!!. Thus, NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry provides an effective method of visualizing vascularization in the brain and other tissues. Morphological and topological features of capillary vessels were quantified in white matter of 7-month-old dtg APP/PS1 mice that deposit relatively high levels of Aß at 4–5 months of age !!!REF!!!. A computerized stereology system was used to estimate the total number of capillary segments, cap, with a single segment defined as the region between two capillary branch points in 3D, using the unbiased disector-based conneulor method !!!REF!!!. Estimates of total capillary length, cap, and length density, V, were made using a novel and efficient technique based on virtual sphere probes !!!REF!!!.  Grammatical gender (henceforth, gender) is a lexical property of nouns that determines agreement relationships among different parts of a sentence (nouns, adjectives, articles and so on), and semantic coherence in discourse !!!REFs!!!. Hence gender constitutes a central aspect of syntactic parsing. In Italian, as in other Romance languages (e.g., French, Spanish), and in contrast to English, all nouns are grammatically marked for masculine or feminine (neuter is absent). Word suffixes play a crucial role in determining the grammatical gender of Italian common nouns. In fact three classes of words exist characterized by different gender-to-ending regularities: (1) “transparent” words that end with the vowel typically associated with their gender (“-a” for feminine and “-o” for masculine); (2) “opaque” words that end in “-e” and in which no gender information can be derived from the suffix; and (3) “irregular” words that end either in “-a” or in “-o”, but whose gender is the opposite of that usually associated with such a vocalic suffix. These words mostly originate from Ancient Greek !!!REF!!!. Consistent evidence exists showing that Italian speakers are more accurate and fast in deciding the gender of a word when the word's suffix corresponds to the most common gender-to-ending distribution (“-a”,“-o”) than when it is opaque (“-e”) !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, the gender decision took longer, and was less accurate, for “irregular” words than for “opaque” words that were in turn slower than “transparent” ones !!!REFs!!!. Gender-to-ending regularity effects were also observed in French !!!REFs!!! and in Hebrew !!!REF!!!. These results suggest that in Italian the gender decision can be performed accessing two independent sources of information respectively based on orthographic/phonological features that comprise gender-marked suffixes, and on lexical information !!!REF!!!. A recent fMRI investigation !!!REF!!! showed that the grammatical features associated with Italian nouns, including gender, are processed in a network that involves frontal (BA 45 and BA 9) and temporal (BA 20/21 and BA 21) areas of the left hemisphere. In that study, participants were shown with words with gender-transparent and gender-opaque suffixes. Participants were asked to perform the following tasks: (1) a gender decision task; (2) a semantic categorization task (i.e., whether the word concept referred to an animal or an artifact); (3) a phonological task (i.e., whether a word contained either a/tch/or a/k/sound). In the baseline condition, participants silently read pseudowords. In contrast to the semantic categorization and to the baseline conditions, the gender decision produced, respectively, activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and of the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 9). Unlike what happened in the phonological task, the gender decision task elicited activations of the left inferior and middle temporal gyrus (BA 20/21 and BA 21) and of two more posterior areas relative to the left parietal lobe (BA 40) and to the left posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31). The BA 40 and BA 31 activations were interpreted as being gender-independent, reflecting an involvement of the working memory circuit. Overall, these results were interpreted as confirming the critical role of the left frontal lobe in morphological and grammatical processing. Another fMRI study !!!REF!!! investigated the neural correlates of grammatical gender decisions in Spanish. Participants were visually presented with “transparent” and “opaque” words and were required to make a gender decision while being scanned. The comparison between opaque and transparent words revealed increased activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in BA 44/45, a more superior locus near BA 44/6 and, bilaterally, in the insula (near BA 47) and the anterior cingulate gyrus for opaque items with respect to transparent ones. The authors argued that the gender decision for opaque words require additional morphological processing as compared to transparent ones and confirmed the critical role played by the left inferior frontal gyrus in processing grammatical information (see !!!REF!!! for similar results with a language production paradigm, and !!!REF!!! on the different neural correlates of syntax in production and in comprehension). These two fMRI studies !!!REFs!!! are based on a controversial cognitive subtraction methodology but, as many authors have clearly pointed out [e.g., !!!REFs!!!], the idea of pure insertion, necessary for subtracting one cognitive ability from another, arbitrarily posits that a cognitive stage can be inserted or deleted without altering the other stages. However, subtracting the neural activation associated with a semantic or a phonological task from the cortical activation associated with a gender decision task might fail to take into account possible interactions between these conditions. To overcome this methodological problem, Sartori and Umiltà !!!REF!!! proposed the “additive-factor method” based on a parametric design that employs a single task across all experimental conditions. In the present study, we adopted a parametric design that manipulated the level of complexity of the gender decision task (see below). The aim of the present fMRI study was to identify the cortical areas involved in retrieving and assigning a gender to Italian nouns. We used an fMRI parametric paradigm in which the difficulty of the task (i.e., the gender decision) varied depending on the gender-to-ending regularity of the word's suffix in that participants were asked to decide the gender of “transparent”, “opaque”, and “irregular” words (see Appendix for the words list). The gender decision task is ideal for the purposes of the present study. It has been widely used in the psycholinguistic and neuropsychological literature in both normal and language-impaired participants (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). Deciding the grammatical gender of a word is a metalinguistic task !!!REFs!!! that relies on different sources of information: (a) morphological information with respect to the inflectional status of the word suffix, at least for the languages with a gender-to-ending regularity effect (Italian !!!REFs!!!, French !!!REFs!!!, Hebrew !!!REF!!!, and Spanish !!!REF!!!); (b) syntactic information since, in Italian, it has been suggested that the lexical retrieval of a noun might include per se the construction of a determiner phrase (i.e., an article + noun representation) that involves syntactic agreement !!!REFs!!!; and (c) lexical information necessary for determining the gender of “opaque” and “irregular” nouns whose gender cannot be derived from the morphological information !!!REF!!!. If these are the sources of information underlying a gender decision, then we should expect activation of a complex distributed and bilateral neural circuit in frontal and temporal areas due to lexical and syntactic information retrieval (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). Specifically, we should expect activation of the cortical regions near the Broca's area, based on gender-related previous studies !!!REFs!!!, of the areas involved in lexical retrieval from semantic memory !!!REF!!!, in subvocal linguistic rehearsal !!!REFs!!! and, more generally, in the recruitment of working memory resources for the generation and maintenance of verbal material !!!REFs!!!. Our parametrical manipulation included an “irregular” condition as well in which the morphological suffix violates the gender-to-ending typical distribution. Therefore a cortical pattern of activation related to an error detection component might be expected in the right and anterior left prefrontal regions !!!REFs!!!.  Our current understanding of brain signal transduction pathway involving nitric oxide synthase (NOS), NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) has mostly emerged from studies performed on the cerebellum. In the rat, neurogenesis of the cerebellum occurs postnatally and although Purkinje cells appear at the embryonic stage (E15), most granule cells undergo post-mitotic migration and establish synaptic connections over the first three postnatal weeks !!!REF!!!. Studies on the expression of brain soluble guanylyl cyclase and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) during ontogeny have revealed very different expression patterns during the postnatal development of the cerebellum. Background levels of the β1 subunit of GC and nNOS transcripts have been found in the neuroepithelium of the cerebellum (E19). By postnatal day 3 (P3), GC β1 mRNA is already expressed, while no message is detected for nNOS. In the molecular layer of the cerebellum the first nNOS mRNA signals appear on P7 and transcripts progressively increased within 2 weeks following birth. The situation in the adult was similar to the one observed at 15 days !!!REF!!!. In the cerebellum (P8 and adult), GC α1 and β1 subunit mRNA levels are high in the Purkinje cell layer, although they are not confined to these cells, and α2 mRNA is abundant in cerebellum granule cells !!!REF!!!. In the cerebellum of 7-day-old rat pups (P7), and in freshly isolated granule cells from pups of this age, the α1 mRNA level is higher than on P14 or P21, whereas α2 mRNA and β1 mRNA increases during the development of cerebellar or granule cells in culture !!!REF!!!. As far as we are aware, there are no data related to the expression of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) during cerebellar development, though both are expressed in adult rat cerebellum. cGKI is mainly expressed in Purkinje cells and moderate to weak cGKII immunostaining has been reported in Purkinje cell somata, dendrites and axons, as well as in narrow fiber-like structures of the molecular layer and some cells of the granular layer !!!REF!!!. In brain, earlier studies demonstrated a very restricted distribution for cGKI, primarily in cerebellar Purkinje cells !!!REF!!!. However, recent findings have indicated the presence of cGKI in other brain regions, such as the dorsomedial hypothalamus !!!REF!!! and hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. cGKII mRNA has been found in many brain regions by in situ hybridisation !!!REF!!!, and cGKII is highly expressed in a multitude of brain regions in which it co-localizes with cGMP increased by NO donors !!!REF!!!. Although the presence of this enzyme has been described in the cell somata of certain neurons and putative oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, its major site of occurrence seems to be the neuropil, suggesting a key role for this enzyme in synaptic transmission !!!REF!!!. Knowledge of the elements of the NO/cGMP signal transduction pathway expressed at a given stage of development will help gain insight into the role played by this pathway in the cerebellum. In this article, we report a comparative analysis of several elements of this signalling pathway – their mRNAs and the proteins they encode – in the developing rat cerebellum. Our study provides clear evidence that nNOS, cGKI and cGKII are differently expressed during cerebellar development.  Eating disorders have become a life-threatening disorder particularly in young women. Anorexics (0.5–1% of all women, especially adolescence) starve themselves and lose body weight !!!REF!!!. On the other extreme, excess weight gain has turned into a major blight in the industrial world, a result of the “fast-food era”—eating more fat, while neglecting exercise !!!REF!!!. Intensive scientific research has been done to find body's “instruction catalogue” that will lead us to understand these eating behaviors. Leptin was found to correlate with the fat body mass and affect food consumption and body energy expenditure !!!REF!!!. Other compounds involved might be the endocannabinoid-derivatives of arachidonic acid !!!REF!!!. The endocannabinoids have been found to affect food consumption homeostasis and weight, behavior, and cognitive function including brain-rewarding processes (alcoholism, cocaine addiction, nicotine consumption, etc.) !!!REF!!!. With the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide (ANA) !!!REF!!!, a fatty acid amide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG) !!!REF!!! a fatty acid ester, it became possible to examine effects of these brain constituents on appetite. Low doses of ANA, 2AG, and THC (0.001mg/kg intraperitonially (i.p.)) were found to improve food intake, cognitive function and reverse some of the neurotransmitter changes caused by diet restriction (DR) in two murine brain areas associated with appetite (hypothalamus) and learning (hippocampus) !!!REFs!!!. Orally administered endocannabinoids can affect food intake and digestive processes via their effects on peristalsis !!!REF!!! and catecholamines !!!REF!!!. Two kinds of cannabinoid receptors, termed CB1 and CB2, have been characterized and cloned !!!REFs!!!. CB1 receptor is mostly distributed in several brain regions, such as the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum !!!REF!!!, while CB2 receptors are found in immune tissues as the spleen, thymus, and tonsils !!!REF!!!, and in some brain disease !!!REFs!!!. Specific antagonists include SR141716A for the CB1 receptor and SR144528 for the CB2 receptor. Noladin, 2-arachidonylglyceryl-ether, was isolated from porcine brain in 2001 !!!REF!!! although, the existence of noladin as an endocannabinoid is still reputed to be controversial !!!REFs!!!. It was identified as an endocannabinoid binding to CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Ethers are generally stable in vivo. In view of the putative stability of Noladin in comparison to anandamide, an amide and 2AG, an ester, which are hydrolyzed rapidly in vivo !!!REF!!!, it may serve as a lead for drug development for eating disorders. In this study, we examine the effect of Noladin (Nol) administration on mice under diet restriction, as a model for anorexia nervosa. Further, we have investigated the long-term effect on body weight after Nol administration, since preliminary results showed that mice under Nol treatment failed to catch-up weight after food deprivation and weight loss.  Copulatory activity in rodents has been shown to promote transient neural changes that can be traced both through behavioural and functional modifications. Thus, male rats that copulate to ejaculation exhibit a hypoalgesic state !!!REF!!! and show a reduction of burying behaviour, considered as an anxiolytic-like behaviour in a conditioned paradigm !!!REFs!!!. A similar effect is observed even after six consecutive ejaculations !!!REF!!!. Besides, ejaculation has been demonstrated to induce a reward state !!!REF!!! and to prolong the duration of the postictal behavioural depression !!!REF!!!. Copulation to exhaustion (4h of ad libitum copulation with a single female), on the other side, has as its main outcome the inhibition of male rat sexual behaviour. Thus, 24h after reaching sexual exhaustion, two-thirds of the exhausted males do not respond to the presence of an oestrus female and the remaining third is able to ejaculate once, without resuming sexual activity !!!REF!!!. Interestingly, other responses appear also modified in sexually exhausted male rats when compared to non-exhausted ones. Thus, sexually satiated animals show an increase in the sensitivity to drug action !!!REFs!!! and in Fos expression !!!REF!!! as well as modifications in the neural control of copulation !!!REF!!!. Hence, prior to sexual exhaustion the electrical stimulation of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) markedly facilitates sexual behaviour, while once sexual exhaustion is established the same animals do no longer respond to this type of stimulation !!!REF!!!. Finally, several evidences show that the sexual behaviour inhibition resulting from copulation to exhaustion relies on a diminished motivation !!!REFs!!!. A diminished motivation is a core symptom of clinical depression that can be manifested as anhedonia and alterations of the appetite, sleep and sexual function !!!REF!!!. Similarly, rodents subjected to procedures that induce a depressive-like state, exhibit behavioural deficits that include changes in sleep and food consumption patterns, loss of the rewarding brain stimulation response, a deficit in passive avoidance performance and impairment of sexual behaviour !!!REFs!!!. These alterations in rodents can be reversed with antidepressant drugs like imipramine or desipramine (DMI) !!!REFs!!!, which have been extensively used in clinical practice. Since sexually exhausted animals show a diminished motivation and this feature is one of the most prominent symptoms of depression, it is possible to assume that exhausted animals could show increased levels of depressive-like behaviour in an animal model. On the other hand, ejaculation has been reported to have reinforcing properties !!!REF!!!. If sexual activity is capable to promote changes in the motivational state then copulation could be expected to modify the development of depressive-like behaviour in an animal model of depression. On these bases, another purpose of the present study was to analyse if different degrees of sexual activity, including one or multiple ejaculation, could influence the expression of depressive-like behaviour in an animal model of depression the forced swimming test (FST). Based on the fact that DMI is one of the antidepressants found to reverse the behavioural deficits associated with diminished motivation in rodents !!!REFs!!!, the last purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of a sub-threshold dose of this noradrenergic antidepressant after the different sexual activity levels in the FST. The FST is an animal model widely used to evaluate the efficacy of antidepressant treatments !!!REF!!!. In this behavioural paradigm a passive behaviour, immobility, is considered to reflect behavioural despair !!!REFs!!!. When antidepressant drugs are administered a reduction in immobility is produced and considered to reflect an antidepressant-like action. Non-pharmacological antidepressant treatments, such as sleep deprivation and electroconvulsive shock, also reduce immobility behaviour in this model !!!REF!!!. In addition, the FST has proved to be sensitive to physiological changes such as steroid level variations along the oestrous cycle !!!REFs!!!. It was, based on these characteristics, that the FST was chosen as a model to measure depressive-like behaviour in this study.  The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibits broad state-specific and frequency-specific topographical differences along the antero-posterior brain axis across subsequent non-REM episodes, with a marked frontal predominance in the delta and alpha band !!!REFs!!!. This anterior predominance is even larger in the recovery sleep that follows both total !!!REFs!!! and selective sleep deprivation !!!REF!!!. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), as measured by PET, is also lower during non-REM sleep than during waking !!!REFs!!! and a notable reduction occurs in the frontal cortical association area !!!REFs!!!. Sleep deprivation further prompts a metabolic decrease of frontal cortices during the ensuing wakefulness !!!REFs!!!. These electroencephalographic and metabolic changes have been interpreted as a sign of an increased local use-dependent sleep intensity, which could reflect a more intense recovery process of frontal and prefrontal areas !!!REFs!!!. Regional changes along the antero-posterior axis actually start during the wakefulness–sleep (W–S) transition, since frequency-specific and topographical EEG changes have already been observed at sleep onset, with a general process of anteriorization of slow and middle EEG frequencies !!!REF!!!. To directly support the hypothesis of anterior-to-posterior processes during sleep onset, we recently used an advanced computational analysis of EEG data, called the directed transfer function (DTF), which provides an estimation of the direction of the information flow underlying cortico-cortical functional coupling !!!REFs!!!. The DTF has shown that the presleep period is characterized by posterior-to-anterior functional cortical coupling, while sleep onset is reflected by an inversion of that direction !!!REF!!!. This finding fully supports the idea that anterior cortical areas first synchronize sleep EEG activity. The aim of the present study was to assess the functional coupling between anterior and posterior midline cortical areas during the sleep onset process, when sleep pressure is heightened by a selective slow-wave sleep (SWS) deprivation. The hypothesis was that the anterior-to-posterior direction of the cortical functional coupling during the wake-to-sleep transition is enhanced by SWS deprivation. This leads to two non-alternative predictions regarding changes in DTF values: the increased sleep pressure should cause: (1) a time advance of the inversion in the direction of antero-posterior functional coupling, which could already be detected in presleep wakefulness; and/or (2) an increase of frontal-to-parietooccipital information flow after sleep onset, as expressed by augmented DTF values.  Cholinergic neurons of the basal nucleus of Meynert (nBM) degenerate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) !!!REFs!!!. The investigation of mechanisms leading to cell death of these cholinergic neurons is an important issue and is focused on the development of strategies to rescue neurons from progressive degeneration. A cascade of pathophysiological events is triggered in AD, and excitotoxic events contribute to cholinergic neuronal loss. Growth factors are very promising molecules to protect neurons against cell death. In adult rats and primates, recombinant exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) prevents the loss of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons in vitro and in vivo !!!REF!!! and is so far the most potent cholinotrophic factor but also, other growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor !!!REF!!!, exert neuroprotective activity on cholinergic neurons, and it is therefore of interest to search for novel cholinotrophic substances. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent angiogenic factors !!!REFs!!! and strongly increases the capillary formation. VEGF is a secreted dimeric protein that is a major regulator of angiogenesis during development, tumor growth and tissue regeneration !!!REF!!!. VEGF binds to at least two receptors, the fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1, VEGFR-1) and to fetal liver kinase (Flk-1/KDR, VEGFR-2). VEGF expression is upregulated in ischemia and hypoxia and is thought to play an important role in hypoxia-induced cerebral angiogenesis !!!REFs!!!. Enhanced VEGF immunoreactivity has been documented in clusters of reactive astrocytes in the neocortex and in the walls of large vessels in subjects with AD !!!REF!!!. However, it remains to be determined whether this increased VEGF expression implies only repair mechanisms to counteract insufficient vascularity !!!REF!!!. Recent reports demonstrated that VEGF stimulates also neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro !!!REF!!! and exerts neuroprotective effects. VEGF also enhanced the survival of mesencephalic neurons in organotypic explant cultures !!!REF!!!, reduced hypoxic death of cultured cerebral cortical neurons !!!REFs!!! and of hippocampal neurons !!!REF!!!, and rescued hippocampal neurons from glutamate- or glutamate agonist -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced toxicity !!!REFs!!!. The aim of the present study was to investigate if VEGF may rescue cholinergjc neurons of the basal nucleus of Meynert from NMDA-induced cell death in vivo. To compare the in vivo effects of VEGF also in vitro, the VEGF effect should be explored in an organotypic brain slice model of nBM neurons. Our present data show that VEGF enhanced the number of vascular structures in vivo and counteracted NMDA-induced cell death of cholinergic neurons of adult rats in vivo. VEGF was not able to rescue cholinergic neurons in developing postnatal organotypic brain slices.  The circadian timing system undergoes marked alterations in mammals during aging. These include weakened ability to synchronize with external stimuli, dampening and fragmentation in activity and temperature cycles, and disruptions in sleep patterns !!!REF!!!. In mammals the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus is considered to be the major pacemaker for circadian oscillations. Whether or not age-related alterations in endogenous biological rhythms reflect primary disturbances in the machinery of the SCN remains to be clarified. On one hand, alterations in the cyclic expression of certain neuropeptides !!!REFs!!! as well as reductions in amplitudes and occurrence of aberrant peaks in the spontaneous firing activity !!!REFs!!! have indicated that properties of individual SCN neurons change with aging. On the other hand, in old rats the cycling of the clock genes and in the SCN remains robust !!!REFs!!!, and the total number of neurons and mean somatic volume of the SCN are unchanged !!!REF!!!, which suggests that disruptions in circadian organization during aging could reflect changes at other levels of the circadian system. The importance of peripheral, extra-SCN oscillators has recently also come into focus !!!REF!!! and age-related disturbances in the interactions between circadian oscillators have been suggested !!!REF!!!. The ventrolateral, or core, part of the SCN receives retinal input, and neurons in this area express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) !!!REF!!!. VIP modulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in the SCN and shows circadian oscillations in its expression !!!REFs!!!. Both responses to light !!!REFs!!! and day/night oscillations of VIP !!!REFs!!! are altered during aging. Electrophysiological studies on the aged SCN have only been made on hamsters and rats previously !!!REFs!!!. In those studies extracellular measurements were performed within the whole SCN, and both studies revealed a reduced amplitude of the rhythm of spontaneous firing. Considering the age-related changes in light responses and VIP expression that occur specifically in the ventrolateral SCN, we wanted to investigate if there are parallel changes in the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. We therefore performed cell attached and whole-cell recordings in the ventrolateral SCN of young and old mice, to study spontaneous firing at the single neuron level as well as synaptic transmission. We report that although the pattern of day/night firing frequencies is similar in the two age groups, there are significant differences at the cellular and synaptic levels.  Vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) is a steroid molecule whose concentration in the body depends on exposure to the sun and diet. In addition to its well-known functions in calcium regulation and bone mineralization !!!REF!!!, Vitamin D3 can regulate immune function !!!REF!!! and cell differentiation !!!REF!!!. Vitamin D3 acts via a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family to directly regulate gene transcription !!!REF!!!. There is now accumulating evidence that Vitamin D3 plays a role in the central nervous system !!!REF!!!. The Vitamin D3 receptor and key enzymes involved in the metabolism of Vitamin D3 are expressed in the rat brain !!!REF!!!. Vitamin D3 also induces the expression of NGF and GDNF !!!REFs!!!. Studies in our laboratories continue to show that the functional outcomes of low maternal Vitamin D3 on the developing brain and the use of Vitamin D3 in neuronal tissue in vitro have produced overwhelming evidence that this vitamin has an important functional role to play during brain development. We demonstrated the presence of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein in rat brain via Western blot, and its transcript via RT-PCR !!!REF!!!. We have recently shown at the immunohistochemical level that VDR is widely distributed throughout the human brain with a strict nuclear sub-cellular location !!!REF!!!. Moreover, we have shown that the absence of Vitamin D3 has a profound impact on developing brain anatomy with newborn offspring of Vitamin D3 deficient dams showing significantly longer (but not wider) brains, with larger lateral ventricles and thinner cortex !!!REF!!!. GDNF and NGF expression are also decreased in this model in vivo !!!REF!!! and increased when the vitamin is added to developing neurons in vitro !!!REF!!!. Finally, we have shown cellular differentiation within the developing brain to be profoundly dysregulated !!!REF!!!. Various clues from the epidemiology of neuropsychiatric diseases also point to a possible link to Vitamin D3 deficiency. Disorders that have increased incidence at high latitudes (e.g. multiple sclerosis) or that have season of birth effects (e.g. schizophrenia) warrant scrutiny with respect to a putative role for hypovitaminosis D3 !!!REFs!!!. Production of Vitamin D3 is strongly associated with the period of sunlight, which is influenced by latitude and season !!!REFs!!!. Even at temperate latitudes hypovitaminosis D3 can be prevalent during winter !!!REF!!!. Hypovitaminosis D3 is common in both developed and developing nations !!!REF!!!. For example, 12% of women of child-bearing age are Vitamin D3 deficient in the USA !!!REF!!!. The optimal level of Vitamin D3 required by the foetus is not known but the requirement increases during pregnancy !!!REF!!! while maternal Vitamin D3 levels fall during the third trimester, especially if this occurs during winter !!!REF!!!. We speculate that the observed changes in neonatal brains from maternally Vitamin D3 deprived environments may have long lasting consequences for the adult offspring even when Vitamin D3 levels are normalized after birth or at weaning. The aims of the present study were to examine the impact of transient developmental Vitamin D3 deficiency on selected outcomes in the adult rat including: (a) gross morphology of the adult brain; (b) the expression of NGF, GDNF and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); and (c) gene expression of neuronal structural proteins and selective neurotransmission elements. Because, the rat brain at birth is relatively immature compared to the human brain at birth !!!REF!!!, we chose to examine two different developmental windows—depletion until birth and depletion until weaning.  Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are mammalian neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep and goat and bovine spongiform encephalopathies in cattle !!!REFs!!!. The causative agent of TSEs is thought to consist of an aberrant isoform (PrPSc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), termed prion !!!REF!!!. PrPSc is generated from the host-encoded PrPC by co- and post-translational modifications leading to selection of given PrP glycoforms and conformational changes in the PrP backbone. Although PrPC and PrPSc share the same amino acid sequence, distinctive physicochemical characteristics differentiate the two isoforms !!!REFs!!!. As opposed to PrPC, PrPSc has a high β-sheet content, is insoluble in non-denaturing detergents and is partially resistant to protease treatment !!!REF!!!. A definite molecular diagnosis of TSE is obtained following the demonstration of PrPSc in affected tissues by immunoblotting and conformation-dependent immunoassay, whereas the diagnostic use of antibodies immunocapturing exclusively PrPSc but not PrPC is under scrutiny !!!REFs!!!. In different TSEs, PrPSc shows distinct conformations, deduced by the size of the unglycosylated PrP27-30 fragment, and strain-specific glycosylation patterns !!!REFs!!!. PrPSc typing represents a useful mean of assessing strain signature in prion diseases, and is currently used to screen small ruminants for the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) !!!REF!!!. In the recent past, this biochemical approach has been of crucial importance in assessing a link between BSE and variant CJD !!!REF!!!. However, the search for molecular similarities among human, bovine, caprine and ovine prion strains requires the use of appropriate antibodies which have been obtained only in a few studies !!!REFs!!!. In the present study, we generated anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by immunizing PrP knock-out mice with recombinant human PrP23–231. In addition to human PrP, these new mAbs cross-reacted with PrP from sheep, goat and cows and appeared useful for the immunodetection of PrP by post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy and in discriminating monoglycosylated PrP species with the second site occupied.  Suckling-induced prolactin release is a widely studied neuroendocrine reflex, comprising a neural afferent and humoral efferent component !!!REF!!!. The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus region appears to be a key structure in the mediation of the suckling stimulus-induced release of prolactin. Lesion of this cell group interferes with the hormone response induced by suckling !!!REF!!!. Frontal knife cut behind this nucleus, horizontal knife cut below the cell group or lesion of the medial subdivision of the nucleus blocks the prolactin response to suckling !!!REF!!!. A significant amount of information has been accumulated suggesting that the excitatory amino acid glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter of the hypothalamus, and besides serotonin, noradrenaline and other stimulatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters may play a critical widespread role in the control of hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons and processes including the control of prolactin secretion !!!REF!!!. Parker and Crowley !!!REF!!! have reported that administration of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2-3-dione (CNQX), in the third ventricle of suckling rats blocked the release of oxytocin and prolactin induced by suckling. Zelena et al. !!!REF!!! have found that combined treatment with NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists, giving the drugs i.v., diminished the suckling-induced prolactin elevation. Glutamate appears to be a prime candidate as a major excitatory signal to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons. This cell group is rich in glutamate receptor mRNA and protein expression !!!REFs!!!, in glutamate/agonist binding !!!REF!!! and in glutamate immunoreactive axons and synapses !!!REFs!!!, as well as it contains glutamatergic neurons and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 protein immunoreactive fibers !!!REFs!!!. All three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors and certain subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors are present in the cell group !!!REFs!!!. Wuarin and Dudek !!!REF!!! have reported that excitatory amino acid antagonists inhibit almost completely synaptic responses in the magnocellular and parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus. van den Pol et al. !!!REF!!! have found that spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the paraventricular nucleus were markedly attenuated by application of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX. The aim of the present investigations was to test the involvement of the glutamatergic innervation of the paraventricular nucleus in the prolactin response to the suckling stimulus. Non-NMDA or NMDA receptor antagonist was injected bilaterally into the paraventricular nucleus of lactating rats 15min before the end of a 4-h separation of the dams from their pups. The litters were returned and the mothers exposed to the suckling stimulus. Blood samples for prolactin were taken at different time points. For testing the selectivity of the effect of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist given into the paraventricular nucleus, the non-NMDA receptor antagonist was also injected into the area of the dorsomedial nucleus or the arcuate nucleus.  The neurobiological basis and the phenomenological aspects of wakeful consciousness, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep are becoming increasingly clarified !!!REF!!!. The transition between wakefulness and sleep is characterized by an abrupt change in consciousness, usually accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations, which are bizarre and vivid like REM sleep dreams !!!REF!!!, but less well understood in physiological terms. Wakefulness–sleep transitions were investigated by mentation reports, as well as with electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging methods !!!REFs!!!. In spite of the major scientific efforts it is still unknown whether stage-1 sleep is actually sleep or some kind of mixture between wakefulness and sleep. Regarding EEG activity, there is a continuous transition between wakefulness and stage-2 sleep, and the EEG-features of NREM sleep evolve gradually during this transitional period !!!REF!!!. However, the subjective experience of hypnagogic hallucinations cannot be explained by NREM sleep initiation processes, because these kinds of vivid sensory experiences are not characteristics of NREM sleep mentation. Vivid hypnagogic imagery owns some of the features of REM sleep dreaming. The similarity between stage-1 and REM sleep EEG has been being obvious since the early time of REM sleep discovery when REM sleep was called emergent stage-1 sleep. Although REM bursts are usually absent during stage-1 sleep, there are slow eye movements occurring occasionally prior to the appearance of sleep spindles !!!REF!!!. However, stage-1 sleep differs from REM sleep by the maintained muscular tone, absent in REM sleep. Although sleep-onset REM phase emergence had been primarily associated with pathological conditions such as narcolepsy and major depression, the rate of its occurrence in non-pathologic population was found to be relatively high, reaching 17% !!!REF!!!. The covert-REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming !!!REF!!! suggests that “hidden” REM sleep features are present during sleep onset, explaining the vivid hypnagogic imagery. Slow eye movements, occurring also in REM sleep, exemplify these “hidden” features. The similarities of the scalp-recorded EEGs of the two states are also called into attention by this theory, but clearly we do not have enough data about the possible similarities and differences between the period of sleep onset and REM sleep. The only functional neuroimaging study examining stage-1 sleep reported occipital lobe blood flow increase as well as cerebellar, posterior parietal, right premotor and left thalamic flow decreases during this transitional state. As functional neuroimaging studies of REM sleep show a different picture, authors speculate that REM sleep and stage-1 sleep are qualitatively different in a way that REM sleep reflects the dreaming state of the unaware, sleeping brain, while stage-1 sleep represents the dreaming state of wakefulness !!!REF!!!. However, no differences were observed between light sleep with and without subjective experiences and the authors themselves hypothesize that the relatively coarse measure of H2 15O PET is unable to detect subtle differences in brain activity. Traditional EEG recording techniques are characterized by low spatial resolution, hence, their ability to measure activity of the hidden surfaces of the brain is limited. In turn modern functional neuroimaging techniques have excellent spatial resolution; however, their temporal resolution to detect subtle state changes in the transition from wakefulness to sleep is still low !!!REF!!!. Intracranial EEG or electrocorticography provides a tool for bridging the gap between these two levels of analysis. By measuring the electrical activity generated by much smaller neuronal networks, electrocorticographic recordings allow the observation of brain signals that would be invisible at the scalp !!!REF!!!. Although there is a controversy regarding the frequency of REM sleep-dependent rhythmic hippocampal slow activity in humans !!!REFs!!!, parahippocampal–hippocampal structures show characteristic and sleep-state specific activity patterns !!!REFs!!!. A distinct 1.5–3.0Hz synchronized parahippocampal activity was observed in REM sleep, which did not occur in NREM sleep and wakefulness !!!REF!!!. Similar delta activity of the human thalamic medial pulvinar nucleus during REM sleep was reported recently !!!REF!!!. However, other studies reported theta-frequency (4–7Hz) activity !!!REF!!! as well as alpha/beta-frequency (10–20Hz) activity !!!REF!!!, both measured over the parahippocampal gyrus and hypothesized to be the human counterparts of hippocampal theta waves originally described in rodents. As hippocampal rhythmic slow activity is synchronous over large mediotemporal areas, it can be recorded in monopolar derivations, provided that the reference point is distant from the hippocampal formation !!!REF!!!. The best method for bipolar recording of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity is to refer electrodes placed below and above the pyramidal layer, respectively !!!REF!!!. Recordings performed with the cortico-cortical bipolar techniques in human subjects may not detect oscillatory activity occurring in unison in the two cortical fields where electrodes were attached. Accordingly, only monopolar, but not bipolar foramen ovale recordings could detect REM sleep-dependent 1.5–3.0Hz parahippocampal activity in humans !!!REF!!!. Intracranially recorded theta-frequency activity (4–7Hz) during human REM sleep was studied only by bipolar derivations !!!REF!!!. The presence of mediotemporal 10–20Hz oscillations during wakefulness and REM sleep of human subjects were evidenced by both bipolar and monopolar derivations !!!REF!!!. This and other methodological differences (wire electrodes, surface electrodes on soft, flexible plastic sheets or multicontact depth electrodes) could be important factors explaining discrepancies between different studies. Measuring the activity of the parahippocampal–hippocampal structures could be useful in delineating the unknown features of the state transition from wakefulness to sleep. Neither electrocorticography nor the invasive deep cortical recording techniques were used before in the analysis of the transition from wakefulness to sleep. The covert-REM sleep hypothesis of dreaming would suggest that a REM-like activity evolves during sleep onset at the time of alpha dropout and this activity persists in the initial part of stage-2 sleep. Since there is neuropsychological evidence for the lack of hippocampal involvement in hypnagogic imagery !!!REF!!!, the analysis of parahippocampal–hippocampal activity during wakefulness–sleep transition is of special interest. Moreover, the inactivity of hippocampal episodic memory system seems to be a common feature of hypnagogic imagery and REM sleep dreams !!!REF!!!. By using monopolar foramen ovale recording technique in epileptic patients, we hypothesize that the previously described REM sleep-dependent 1.5–3.0Hz activity increases during sleep onset, correlates with alpha dropout and persists in the initial part of stage-2 sleep.  Electrophysiological tools have been widely used to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in animal and human epileptogenesis. More specifically, the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons have been investigated both in slices and in isolated cells maintained in culture !!!REFs!!!. Most of “in vitro” analyses rely on the comparison between the cellular properties of samples from the “epileptic” brain with those of “normal” control tissue. A great deal of discussion exists concerning what is an appropriate control in such experiments and the problem is still not completely solved. In general, two quite wide and fundamental issues are investigated. First the intrinsic properties of neurons from the epileptic brain and second the synaptic communication between these cells. From an electrophysiological perspective, epilepsies are taken as disorders of neuronal excitability, which can be characterized in a neuronal population (circuitry), in individual neurons and/or at the single ion channel level !!!REF!!!. Not surprisingly a growing number of papers report on the involvement of altered potassium channels in several pathologies of the nervous system, particularly in genetic forms of epilepsy !!!REFs!!!. It has been shown that the intrinsic properties of pyramidal cells of the human neocortex, are similar to those described for pyramidal cells of rat, cat and monkey with respect to resting potential, input resistance ( INPUT), membrane time constants and action potentials !!!REFs!!!. Intracellular recordings in CA1 neurons of hippocampal slices from rats electrically kindled in the amygdala !!!REF!!! revealed no alterations in the passive properties of these cells when compared to the controls. However, about 1/3 of these kindled cells exhibited a firing pattern in “bursts” when injected with depolarizing currents. In similar experiments with CA1 hippocampal slices from adult genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs), Verma-Ahuja and Pencek !!!REF!!! found an increase in INPUT and a reduction in the amount of current necessary to evoke excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs). The dentate granule cells and the pyramidal cells are the principal components involved in the hippocampal physiology, where GABA and Glu are the dominant neurotransmitters !!!REFs!!!. Inhibition mediated by GABA modulates sensorial input, motor output and maintains a “basal” level of excitability in the entire brain of mammals. Any decrease of inhibition mediated by GABA can lead to increased excitability which frequently appears as epileptic activity. Therefore, alterations in excitation/inhibition balance could explain the hyperexcitability and hypersynchronism typically found in epilepsies !!!REFs!!!. High intensity acoustic stimulation can induce acutely tonic-clonic seizures in audiogenic susceptible animals !!!REF!!!. In contrast, when submitted to daily repeated acoustic stimuli animals from several audiogenic strains (Illinois, Strasbourg, Ribeirão Preto) develop behavioral, electrophysiological and plastic alterations that involves recruitment of cortical and limbic structures !!!REFs!!!. Garcia-Cairasco and co-workers were the first to show neuroethological, electrophysiological (hippocampus, amygdala and cortex) and cellular correlates (neurogenesis) of limbic recruitment in WARs !!!REFs!!!. Thus, we decided to investigate possible alterations in passive and active cell membrane properties including voltage (potassium) and ligand (GABA and Glu) activated currents in cultured hippocampal neurons of neonatal WARs. In summary our results show a significant reduction in the A type GABAergic current in WARs, associated to the maintenance of normal levels of the excitatory glutamatergic currents. In addition, cells from WARs also showed an increased INPUT and a more depolarized membrane potential, reinforcing the reduction in the inhibitory current density. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of epileptogenicity in WARs.  Sodium valproate (VPA) has been widely used as an anticonvulsant and, more recently, as an anti-manic agent in the treatment of bipolar disorder !!!REF!!!. Psychiatric disorders are thought to be caused not by a single gene abnormality, but by a set of changes in the expression of different genes !!!REF!!!. Evidence that VPA requires several days to show its clinical efficacy suggests that alterations at the genomic level may play a role in the mechanism of action of this drug !!!REF!!!. Indeed, VPA has been reported to affect several pathways that involve transcription factors and kinases that activate them !!!REF!!!, creating a range of influence on neuroprotection !!!REF!!!, differentiation, anti-tumorigenic effects !!!REF!!!, and neural tube defects !!!REF!!!. Specifically, VPA in cultured cells increases the activity of the DNA binding protein activator protein (AP-1) and of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) that regulates gene expression on the AP-1 pathway !!!REF!!!. The AP-1 family of transcription factors, in turn, regulates several genes in the brain such as neuropeptides, neurotrophins, receptors, other transcription factors, enzymes involved in neurotransmitter biosynthesis and proteins that interact with cytoskeletal elements !!!REF!!!. VPA also has been shown to affect protein kinase C (PKC) activity and the expression of one of its substrates, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) !!!REF!!!. There is further evidence that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is indirectly inhibited by VPA in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular proliferation, cell migration and polarity, and carcinogenesis !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, a VPA-induced increase in gene expression has been demonstrated for the Bcl-2 genes, growth cone-associated p43, and tyrosine hydroxylase gene !!!REF!!!. A recent study using oligonucleotide microarray technology has shown that in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical cells valproate also modulates the expression of three isoenzymes of glutathione-S-transferase, which play a role in defense against oxidative stress !!!REF!!!. In order to identify new signaling pathways affected by valproate and to elucidate its mechanism of action as a mood-stabilizing agent, we examined brain gene expression in rats chronically administered sodium valproate, using GeneChip® Arrays. Since valproate is distributed throughout the brain and its effect on overall brain gene expression has not been examined to date, we thought it of interest to look at the changes in gene expression in the whole brain before examining the changes in individual regions.  The dopaminergic systems have been the focus of much research, mainly because several neuropsychiatric disorders and conditions such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, substance abuse, and Huntington's disease are widely accepted to have a basis in a dysregulation of dopaminergic transmission. In general, dopamine (DA) receptors are classified into two broad families, namely the D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Both the D1 and the D2 receptors are abundantly expressed and widely distributed throughout striatal and limbic dopamine fields, including the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle !!!REFs!!!. Stimulation of the D1-like receptors increases stereotypical oral behavior in the animals !!!REF!!!. Activation of either D1- or D2-like receptors results in increase of locomotion !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptors is essential to produce maximum locomotor activation !!!REFs!!!. On the contrary, D3-prefering agonists inhibit locomotor activity !!!REFs!!!. The D3 receptor has a specific distribution to limbic areas such as the shell of the nucleus accumbens, the olfactory tubercle, and the islands of Calleja of both Sprague-Dawley (SD) !!!REFs!!! and Wistar (W) !!!REF!!! rats. These limbic areas of the brain are associated with emotional and endocrine functions, and seem to mediate some of the effects of antipsychotic drugs and drugs used against Parkinson's disease, which were previously thought to interact only with D2 receptors !!!REF!!!. The most used strains of rats in research are the W and SD. Some studies have shown differences between these two strains in neurobiological functions !!!REFs!!!. Differences in the prepulse inhibition–disruptive effects of apomorphine have been reported between W and SD rats !!!REFs!!!, and several studies indicated that mesolimbic and nigrostriatal DA transmission may, in part, regulate the prepulse inhibition (PPI) !!!REFs!!!. DA plays an important role in the control of many neurobiological functions, including locomotion, emotional behavior, cognition, positive reinforcement, and neuroendocrine regulation. The immobility response (IR) is regulated by emotions such as fear, and by dopaminergic drugs such as haloperidol (DA antagonist). The IR is considered a temporary state of profound motor inhibition and relative unresponsiveness caused experimentally by some types of stimulation and restraint. The manipulations used in the laboratory to induce IR are an attempt to simulate the physical restraints that can result in the immobility of a prey when caught or carried by a predator. In nature, this behavior is part of antipredatory behavior and the last resource used by prey to reduce the probability of continued attack by the predator !!!REFs!!!. This immobility can be produced experimentally in a variety of species !!!REF!!!. In rats, the immobility induced by clamping the neck (ICN) is caused by clamping the skin of the nape and placing the animal on its back !!!REF!!!. Another kind of immobility, the dorsal immobility (DI), also can be triggered in the rat by grasping the animal by the skin of the dorsal surface of the neck and lifting it off its feet !!!REF!!!. Many brainstem and basal forebrain regions have been implicated in the IR. One part of the neural mechanism may include descending motor inhibition, known to arise from the medial reticular formation (MRF). Modulating influences on the MRF come from other parts of the brain, most notably the limbic system (fear potentiates IR), the neocortex, which inhibits IR, and the basal ganglia (dopaminergic blockade in the striatum promotes IR) !!!REF!!!. Fear-provoking stimuli, such noise and electric shock, potentiate IR, whereas those stimuli that are fear-reducing, such a handling, taming, and repeated testing, cause the response to wane !!!REFs!!!. In lizards, lesions of the homologous mammalian central amygdale reduce the duration of IR !!!REF!!!. In our study, we investigated some DA-mediated behaviors and the regional distribution and levels of DA receptor subtypes (D1-like, D2-like, and D3) and DA transporters in the basal ganglia and limbic subregions of W and SD rats using quantitative autoradiography. In behavioral experiments, open-field activity and immobility responses were measured in both W and SD rats. The differences observed between these strains for DA receptors and DA transporter, together with DA-related behaviors, are discussed.  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenarative disease that involves aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide !!!REFs!!! leading to activation of glia (gliosis) prior to the deposition of amyloid plaques and formation of neurofibrillary tangles in degenerated neurons that ascend from the basal forebrain to cortical and hippocampal areas !!!REF!!!. The search for AD pathogenic factors is hindered by the lack of diagnostic certainty in life and by the heterogeneity of the disease !!!REF!!!. Recent reports suggest that perturbations in systems using the excitatory amino acid l-glutamate (l-Glu) may underlie such pathogenic mechanisms of AD !!!REFs!!!. Along with l-Glu, biogenic amines viz., 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) have been identified as the principal transmitters mediating fast excitatory synaptic responses in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) and have widespread influence on the cortex, basal ganglia, limbic areas and spinal cord. They play an important role in regulation of brain functions: memory, mood, movement, behavior and autonomic functions such as blood pressure regulation. These functions are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to loss of the catecholamines (CA) neurons, which regulate the brain functions !!!REF!!!. The major and well-documented concept in neurodegenerative disorder is the deficiency of the cholinergic system due to the progressive loss of cholinergic presynaptic neurons situated in the basal fore brain that leads to structural and functional damage of monoaminergic systems !!!REFs!!!. The neurodegenerative disease condition can be induced by different insults that have been related to systemic oxidative stress such as inflammatory stimulus !!!REF!!!. Lemere et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated that intranasal immunization with freshly solubilized Aβ 1–40 reduced cerebral amyloid burden in PDAPP mouse (PDAPP mouse is a model of familial Alzheimer's disease in which mice express the human V717F mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene under the control of the platelet derived (PD) growth factor-beta promoter). The Antibodies formed against Aβ might stimulate Aβ clearance by stimulating Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Aβ by microglia !!!REF!!!. In addition antibodies against Aβ might act as an artificial chaperone for extra cellular amyloid-β and prevent aggregation of amyloid β by binding to epitopes !!!REF!!!. However, phase II clinical trial with the immunization of AD patients with amyloid peptides has recently ended prematurely because of cerebral hemorrhage due to inflammation observed in several patients !!!REF!!!. Neocortex and hippocampus are susceptible to neurodegeneration in response to an external insult such as infection and/or oxidative stress that leads to disruption of the neuronal circuitry of the hippocampus and neocortex cerebral areas !!!REFs!!!. In the past decade an extraordinary progress has been made to understand the toxicity of Aβ peptide. Presently, compounds targeting Aβ vaccination hold much promise as therapy for AD. Therapies that decrease Aβ production, enhance its degradation or cause its clearance from CNS are the two major therapeutic ventures being pursued by various group of researchers. One of the most promising approaches towards the Aβ clearance is the use of immunotherapies, including vaccination with Aβ fragments !!!REF!!!. However, inflammation is the limiting factor in therapy due to the sudden increase in the soluble Aβ peptide in the peripheral and brain tissues on vaccination. dl-α-Lipoic acid (LA) and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) are natural potent antioxidants and cofactors of mitochondrial decarboxylation enzymatic reactions and essential for an adequate ATP production through citric acid cycle !!!REF!!!. They are involved in different multi enzyme complexes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase and glycine decarboxylase complex !!!REF!!!. LA, a low molecular substance which is absorbed and able to cross blood brain barrier !!!REF!!! in animals, and preliminary human studies indicate that LA has neuroprotective effects on Aβ mediated cytotoxicity and may be effective in a number of neurodegenerative diseases !!!REF!!!. The antioxidant therapy along with Aβ vaccination reduces the inflammation associated with Aβ vaccination. Our preliminary biochemical and histological investigation shows that LA therapy reduces the oxidative vulnerability of Aβ vaccination and that it is a good candidate in inflammatory AD models where active immunization is administered !!!REF!!!. This study was focused on the quantitative analysis of central nervous system neurotransmitters (DA, NE and 5-HT) and its metabolites (HVA and 5-HIAA) in neocortex and hippocampus by the aid of isocratic RP–HPLC system with electrochemical detection. We have used one of the important antigenic fragment of Aβ25–35 as peptide vaccination candidate which exhibit all the biological activity of the full length Aβ !!!REFs!!! and is used by other researchers to study the neuronal toxicity and oxidative vulnerability extensively !!!REF!!!.  Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, which has been implicated in several physiological functions such as vasodilation, synaptic activity and neuronal development !!!REFs!!!. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that synthesizes NO, is ubiquitously distributed in the central nervous system, including the retina !!!REF!!! and co-localizes with NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity !!!REF!!!; thus, the NADPH-d histochemical reaction can be used as a simple and reliable way to identify cells synthesizing NOS !!!REF!!!. In the human retina, Provis and Mitrofanis !!!REF!!! revealed three morphological classes of NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells, characterized by their soma size and shape. In the rat, NADPH-d histochemistry reveals principally one class, a long-range amacrine cell !!!REFs!!! (type I) located in the inner nuclear layer (INL). Type II cells (displaced amacrine cells), described by Kim and co-workers !!!REFs!!!, have not been described by other authors !!!REF!!!. In mammals, several authors have also reported other retinal cell types that are NOS-immunoreactive !!!REFs!!!. Recently, a close association has been shown between NOS-immunoreactive and NADPH-d-stained amacrine cell bodies, their processes and retinal blood vessels !!!REF!!!. NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells completely disappear in nNOS knock out mice !!!REF!!!, and NO from a neuronal source is thought to play a role in linking retinal activity, blood flow and metabolism !!!REF!!! as has also been suggested for the brain !!!REF!!!. In the developing rat, NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells have been documented in the peripheral retina as early as postnatal day (P)3 !!!REF!!!. NOS-immunoreactive amacrine cells in the central retina are detected slightly later on P5 !!!REFs!!!. NOS-immunoreactive and NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells are fully differentiated by the second postnatal week, when eyes open, thus NO-synthesizing neurons in the retina are developmentally regulated, suggesting that NO released from these cells plays a role in retinal maturation. Many subtypes of retinal neurons are distributed across the retina as arrays of non-randomly organized elements. When performing a spatial analysis, a non-random distribution of points (in our case, neurons) may be clustered or regular, where clustered means that neurons are organized in groups whereas regular means that neurons are uniformly distributed in the map. A regular organization is often referred to as a mosaic, in which array–homotypic cells maintain a fixed minimum distance !!!REF!!!. Regular mosaics have been described for basically all the principal types of retinal neurons that share homogeneous morphological and physiological properties !!!REF!!!, from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells !!!REFs!!!. Such regular arrays offer advantages for the spatial sampling of visual input, and represent a prominent feature of retinal organization. In the present study, we focus on a quantitative analysis of the distribution of NADPH-d-positive neurons in the rat retina from neonatal life until maturity, studying whether or not the distribution of NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells in the adult rat is regular, and whether this regularity is established from early stages of development or is acquired through the elimination/addition of new elements to the pattern. In order to perform an analysis of the spatial distribution of NADPH-d-positive neurons in the retinae, we studied the Voronoi domains, as has already been done by other authors for other cell types in the retina !!!REFs!!! and has been proposed to study cell sociology !!!REF!!!.  The effects that the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis may have on brain functions have become under intensive investigation during the past decade !!!REF!!!. Both hormones are produced in most areas of the brain and have been shown to exhibit distinct but overlapping functions. Both GH and IGF-1 affect the size and morphology of the central nervous system (CNS) during development and alter differentiated cell functions like neural growth, myelination, and cognitive performance !!!REFs!!!. With increasing age the GH/IGF-1 axis undergoes changes such as decreased GH and IGF-1 concentrations in the brain. This decline in hormone levels has been associated with changes of certain CNS functions such as age-related memory impairments !!!REF!!!. Several clinical and animal studies on central effects of altered GH and/or IGF-1 status have been published and the role of these hormones in cognitive processes in aged objects are in some cases contradictory (for review; see !!!REF!!!) and their clinical relevance is debated. The brain substrates of learning and memory include several areas, one of which is the hippocampus. This region has received particular attention in studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), two mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity involving glutamate transmission !!!REF!!!. Induction of LTP in the hippocampal formation requires NMDA receptors and agonistic effects at this receptor increases the cognitive capability, whereas antagonists impair learning and memory abilities !!!REF!!!. In the rat the NMDA receptor complex comprises several subunits, including NR1, NR2A, NR2B and NR2C !!!REFs!!!. Among other factors, the expression of these receptor subunits appears to be modulated by age and IGF-1 and has been suggested to be involved in age-related decline in memory and learning capabilities !!!REF!!!. In particular the NR2B receptor subunit has been suggested to be of importance in this context as it has been demonstrated that hippocampal NR2B deficit mimics age-related changes in LTP and spatial learning !!!REF!!!. Moreover, a recent study using transgenic mice has shown that over-expression of the NR2B subunit is connected with enhanced cognitive performance !!!REF!!!. It is further suggested that a high ratio of NR2B/NR2A is connected with enhanced LTP, while a low ratio is believed to correlate with LTD !!!REFs!!!. We recently demonstrated that GH may affect the expression of the NMDA receptor subunit gene transcripts in the hippocampus of both young (11 weeks) and a group of older (14–16 months) rats !!!REF!!!. The NR2B/NR2A mRNA ratio was significantly increased in the former but not in the latter group of rats following 10 daily injections of the hormone. In addition, the hippocampal expression of the GHR gene transcript was significantly up-regulated following GH injections in young animals. A significant positive correlation between the level of GHR mRNA and the expression of the NR2B subunit transcript was also found among treated young rats. The molecular mechanism by which GH elicits effects on the expression of the NMDA receptor subunit gene transcripts in hippocampus is not clear. Since GH is known to induce some of its effects through IGF-1-release, a co-ordination with IGF-1 could be a possible route of GH action. To address this question further, we examined in a parallel experiment the effect of daily s.c. injection for 10 days of human IGF-1 in male rats of different age. Following completed treatment, the hippocampal gene expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as GHR, GHBP and IGF-1R transcripts were analysed. This experiment and the previously published report concerning GH treatment !!!REF!!!, were performed at the same occasion, therefore the untreated animals serve as controls in both studies. The effect of age on the transcript levels of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GHR and GHBP between these control groups were discussed in connection to the previous study !!!REF!!!. Here, these rats only served as controls for the IGF-1 treated animals. The results resemble in much those induced by GH, suggesting a co-operative action of the two hormones.  Short-term memory (STM) can be easily investigated by so called delayed-response tasks. In delayed-response tasks, subject has to retain a cue stimulus and a related motor response across a delay period up to an imperative go stimulus. In the STM variant of the task, the cue stimulus rapidly disappears. In the control variant (no STM, NSTM), the cue stimulus is delivered during the delay period. With respect to “delayed match-to-sample” and “n-back” STM paradigms, the delayed-response tasks include no probe stimulus to be matched with the memorized cue stimulus. The delayed-response tasks have been successfully used for the study of cognitive processes in schizophrenia and aging !!!REFs!!!. Neurobiological correlates of the delayed-response tasks have been extensively investigated in the nonhuman primates !!!REFs!!!. Fronto-parietal systems are involved in the maintenance of the “representational memory” during delayed-response tasks !!!REFs!!!. In humans, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have confirmed the crucial role of the fronto-parietal cortical system for a successful performance in the STM variant of delayed-response tasks. This system included dorsolateral prefrontal (Brodmann area 8–9 (BA 8–9)), lateral and medial premotor (BA 6L and BA 6M), and posterior parietal (BA 7, 40) areas. The right dorsolateral prefrontal area was especially involved when visuo-spatial contents had to be memorized !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, recent fMRI studies have experimentally dissociated two parallel processes related to STM tasks, namely “maintenance” of motor responses during the delay period and “selection” of an item from memory to guide the motor response !!!REFs!!!. “Selection”, but not “maintenance”, was associated with the activation of BA 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, “maintenance” was associated with the activation of prefrontal BA 8 and the intra-parietal cortex. Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormal cortical activity associated with losses in STM with age (for a review see !!!REF!!!). However, this research field is characterized by great methodological difficulties, due to the relatively poor cognitive performances of aged people to standard STM tasks. Indeed, neuroimaging study of cognition across aging requires simple tasks ensuring: (i) high rate of correct performances in stressful neurophysiological settings; and (ii) significant modulation of the cortical activity. Neuroimaging data accompanying correct performances are at the basis of comparisons between normal young versus elderly subjects and between normal elderly subjects and elderly subjects with cognitive impairments. As a preliminary step, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested the hypothesis that very simple delayed-response tasks fit these requirements in normal young adults. The STM variant included a sequence of cue stimulus (two vertical bars of unequal height), delay period (blank screen for only 5s), go stimulus, and motor response compatible with the taller vertical bar. Noteworthy, the retention (only one bit) could be based on visuospatial, phonological, and somatomotor coding. In the control variant (no STM), the cue stimulus was present during the delay period. In previous studies, the same tasks have been able to modulate electroencephalographic rhythms in frontal and parietal areas of normal young !!!REFs!!! and elderly !!!REF!!! adults. However, it should be stressed that electroencephalographic techniques prevented a fine topographical analysis of these cortical responses.  It is well known that physiological aging affects cognitive performances. Compared to young subjects, normal elderly subjects present a slowing down of information processing including a decline of “on-line” short-term retention or manipulation of information !!!REFs!!!. Physiological aging is also associated with a power decline of electroencephalographic alpha rhythms (6–12Hz) recorded during relaxed wakefulness !!!REFs!!!. Such an alpha power decline is more pronounced in elderly subjects suffering from mild cognitive impairments !!!REFs!!!. In that case, the resting alpha rhythms have an intermediate magnitude with respect to those observed in normal elderly and dementia subjects !!!REFs!!!. Physiological aging affects not only the resting but also the event-related alpha rhythms. Short-term memory (STM) demands induce a typical reduction of alpha power (8–13Hz), the so-called event-related desynchronization (ERD), indicating a cortical activation !!!REF!!!. The topography of alpha ERD is more circumscribed in elderly than young subjects during STM demands !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, the amplitude of alpha ERD is reduced as a function of physiological aging !!!REFs!!!. The effects of aging on alpha rhythms are not surprising. In resting adults, alpha rhythms reflect the activity of dominant oscillatory neural networks and represent a very global functional feature of working brain !!!REF!!!. Alpha rhythms are mainly modulated by thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical interactions, which facilitate/inhibit (i) the transmission of sensorimotor information between subcortical and cortical pathways and (ii) the retrieval of semantic information from cortical storage !!!REFs!!!. In the resting condition, alpha rhythms showing high voltage are usually associated with healthy brain functioning. Low-band alpha rhythmHz) would be mainly related to global attentional readiness, whereas high-band alpha rhythms (10–12Hz) would reflect the oscillation of specific neural systems for the elaboration of sensorimotor or semantic information !!!REFs!!!. With reference to physiological aging, dementia has severe effects on cognitive functions such as attention, STM, long-term memory, and linguistic skills. Furthermore, both vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients frequently experience deficits in frontal executive functions including focused attention, span capacity of information management, decision processes based on instructions and past experience, control of impulsive responses, and selection/running of proper responses !!!REFs!!!. An issue of interest is, hence, the definition of an experimental set up for a simple assessment of these executive functions during acquisition of neurophysiological data. To this aim, a promising approach is the use of the so-called delayed response tasks !!!REFs!!! in which subject has to retain a “cue” stimulus and a related motor response across a delay period up to an imperative “go” stimulus. This is a quite simple experimental condition that can probe also STM, in the case in which “cue” stimulus disappears during the delay period. The advantage of this approach for the study of pathological aging is the simplicity of the STM demands, given that “cue” stimulus can be retained by phonological and somatomotor coding even when the overt demand is visuo-spatial (i.e. where was the position of the “cue” stimulus?). Delayed response tasks induce visible changes in the alpha rhythms of normal young !!!REFs!!! and elderly !!!REF!!! subjects. In young adults, alpha ERD reduces its amplitude with the STM variant of delayed responses !!!REFs!!!. In the same condition, frontal alpha ERD is lower in amplitude in normal young than elderly subjects, in line with the notion of a lower engagement of frontal executive circuits in young people !!!REF!!!. To our knowledge, no clear evidence is currently available on alpha ERD of demented patients during delayed response tasks, possibly for the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of correct behavioral responses in the framework of electroencephalographic recordings. In the present study, we tested whether two very simple delayed response tasks could affect midline alpha ERD in demented patients compared to normal young and elderly subjects. In the STM variant of delayed response task, subjects had to retain a very simple visual “cue” stimulus (just one bit) for a few seconds. In the no short-term memory (NSTM) variant, the “cue” stimulus was available up to the “go” stimulus. The rationale for so low-demanding cognitive tasks is that neurophysiological studies are based on many repetitions of short trials, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. The simplicity of the task is supposed to minimize fatigue/distraction and to maximize the amount of correct behavioral responses whose neural correlates are compared between control and demented subjects. Here a further reduction of fatigue/distraction for the patients was ensured by the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In contrast to electroencephalography, MEG technique includes a very quick and comfortable procedure for the montage of recording sensors, very suitable for the neurophysiological study of cognitive functions in aged people. In particular, the main scientific issues were the following. Can demented patients perform simple delayed response tasks with a sufficiently large amount of correct behavioral responses for the subsequent alpha ERD analysis? Can that analysis reveal changes in the latency and amplitude of the alpha ERD in demented patients compared to control subjects? In these patients, can a so slight STM load (just one bit) affect the latency and amplitude of the alpha ERD?  The neurophysiological basis of cognitive changes with normal ageing is not well understood. According to some studies, much of the age-associated decline in cognition is accounted for by slowing of processing and response speed or reduced information processing ability, such as in working memory and attentional-executive tasks !!!REF!!!. Underlying these changes is possibly some disruption of fronto-subcortical circuits, but evidence for this is limited. Structural imaging studies indicate that there is loss of cortical volume, enlargement of ventricles !!!REF!!! and gliosis !!!REF!!! associated with ageing, but these measures have poor correlation with neuropsychological function. Synapse number and neuronal number have also been found to decline during ageing, although new unbiased stereological methods indicate that previous results are probably due to shrinkage rather than cell loss !!!REF!!!. Functional imaging studies show that there are relatively slight reductions in total cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) with ageing !!!REF!!!, with decreases in rCBF possibly being more pronounced in frontal and parietal regions !!!REF!!!. During cognitive tasks, ageing brains tend to have reduced activation in the frontal cortex !!!REF!!!, but, improved performance on the cognitive tasks is associated with recruitment of additional brain regions, indicating that there are compensatory mechanisms in operation !!!REFs!!!. One method of determining the functional integrity of brain regions is to examine their neurochemistry. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) allows the non-invasive in vivo analysis of certain neurometabolites that indicate biochemical changes in the brain. The major metabolites detected by this technique are -acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-related compounds (Cho), creatine (Cr) and myo-inositol (mI). While the functional roles of these metabolites are not fully known, in simple terms NAA may be considered to be a marker of neuronal viability, Cr is involved in energy metabolism, Cho is associated with membrane turnover and mI is a putative glial cell marker !!!REF!!!. A number of studies have attempted to correlate MRS-visible metabolites with cognitive function. NAA in the occipito-parietal white matter has been shown to be associated with both full-scale intelligence quotient !!!REF!!! and neuropsychological measures of cognition !!!REF!!! in young adults, particularly on timed tests. In a study of elderly males, a correlation was observed between NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in the parietal white matter and various cognitive measures including logical memory and verbal memory factor, possibly accounted for by changes in Cr !!!REF!!!. In a previous report !!!REF!!!, we observed a correlation between NAA/Cr in the left frontal subcortical white matter and attentional processing ability, which is functionally associated with this region. Verbal fluency and memory were not correlated with NAA/Cr in this area of the brain, nor were there any associations between measures in the occipito-parietal gray matter and cognition in these subjects. This suggests that changes in frontal white matter are related to particular changes in cognition that may be associated with the ageing process. In yet another study, whole brain gray matter NAA was positively correlated with performance in a verbal memory task in elderly healthy controls, but this correlation was not observed in the white matter !!!REF!!!. We studied a group of 59 healthy elderly subjects in a further attempt to determine the relationship between brain neurometabolites in frontal white matter and occipito-parietal gray matter with cognitive performance. We hypothesised that NAA would be correlated with cognitive performance, particularly in the frontal white matter, and the relationship would be stronger on neuropsychological tests that are timed.  Among several functions observed, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) is well known as an important regulator of calcium signaling in synaptic transmission by phosphorylating various proteins, including neuronal membrane receptors and intracellular transcription factors. In general, inflammation or injuries to peripheral tissues cause long-lasting increases in the responses of central nociceptive neurons to innocuous and noxious stimuli (central sensitization) !!!REFs!!!. Recently, Fang et al. !!!REF!!! have reported that phosphorylated CaMK-II (pCaMK-II) is involved in the regulation of nociception. They found that pCaMK-II is increased at the spinal cord level during noxious inflammatory stimulation by intraplantar capsaicin administration. This group has proposed that the long-lasting increase in excitability of spinothalamic tract cells depends on the activation of CaMK-II located in the spinal dorsal horn !!!REF!!!. Additionally, pCaMK-II is involved in the suppression of inhibitory currents induced by substance P !!!REF!!!. In an animal model of neuropathic pain, it has been reported that formalin injection elevated pCaMK-II level or activity, which was involved in phosphorylation of NMDA receptor NR2A/B. These changes may be responsible for sensitization of behavioral reflexes !!!REF!!!. In addition, CaMK-II located in the superficial layers of the spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglion may be involved in the internalization and translocation of μ1 opioid receptors, which contribute to the development of tolerance to opioid analgesics !!!REF!!!. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CaMK-II is present in small diameter primary sensory neurons, and may play a role in noxious inflammatory state !!!REF!!!. However, in supraspinal region, a regulatory function of pCaMK-II is not fully characterized yet. Of particular interest in supraspinal subcortical regions are the hypothalamus and hippocampus. There are massive spinal projections to the hypothalamus directly or indirectly that are involved in autonomic, neuroendocrine, and emotional responses to somatosensory stimulation, including painful stimuli in the rat !!!REFs!!!. Neuronal pathways from the spinal cord to limbic or cortico-limbic structures indicate the involvement in affective aspects of pain and integration of nociceptive input with contextual memory !!!REF!!!. Moreover, it is evident that adaptive mechanisms in limbic areas may be involved in the decreased response to painful stimuli after stress exposure !!!REFs!!!. Electrical stimulation of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus induces pain expression in guinea pigs !!!REF!!! and monkeys !!!REF!!!. Moreover, analgesia is produced by lidocaine microinjection or blockade of NMDA receptors in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. It is also well known that CaMK-II in CA1 post-synaptic neurons of hippocampus has an important role in the production and maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation, which is thought to contribute to learning and memory processes (for review, see !!!REF!!!). However, the involvement of CaMK-II in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in the regulation of nociception is not known currently. Although intrathecal (i.t.) substance P pain model !!!REFs!!! has been widely used to study nociceptive/antinociceptive mechanisms, little is known on the possible involvement of CaMK-II, in the regulation of nociception. Furthermore, the effect of a CaMK-II inhibitor on pain behaviors induced by SP was examined. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the expression of pCaMK-II after i.t. SP administration at spinal and supraspinal levels.  Cholinergic afferents from the nucleus basalis of Meynert project to all layers of the cerebral cortex accounting for 70–80% of cortical cholinergic input !!!REF!!!. There are five muscarinic cholinergic receptors (M1–M5) and all are G-protein coupled. Although all cortical muscarinic receptor subtypes occur postsynaptically, the M2 receptor is also found on presynaptic neurons and serves as an autoreceptor !!!REFs!!!. Altered cholinergic neurotransmission has been suggested to occur in several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Considerable evidence suggests increased cholinergic neurotransmission in bipolar mania and major depression disorders !!!REFs!!!. In addition, evidence from both post-mortem !!!REFs!!! and imaging studies !!!REF!!! implicates muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. We have previously shown a significant decrease in [3H]pirenzepine binding to M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in both superficial (I–II) and deep (III–VI) layers of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in schizophrenia !!!REF!!!, a brain area that receives dense cholinergic innervation !!!REF!!! and is involved in cognition and attention control. In the same study, we found no differences in [3H]pirenzepine binding in the ACC, in bipolar, and major depression patients. The present study aimed to extend these findings by examining the binding of [3H]AF-DX 384 that binds with high affinity to both M2 and M4 receptors !!!REF!!!. Using quantitative autoradiography we measured [3H]AF-DX 384 binding in the ACC in the same cohort of subjects used in our previous study. Post-mortem tissue obtained from the Stanley Foundation Brain Bank !!!REF!!!.  Cobalt and other trace metals like copper, iron, zinc, manganese and molybdenum maintain living systems through catalytic and structural roles they can play in proteins and other biomolecules. In previous studies the structural aspects and biological importance of the complexes formed by GnRH with copper, nickel, zinc and cobalt were estimated !!!REFs!!!. Cobalt complex with GnRH (Co-GnRH) showed a binding affinity to GnRH receptor competing with buserelin, a highly potent analog of GnRH !!!REFs!!!. GnRH is a key neurohormone responsible for the central regulation of gonadotropin (LH, FSH) secretory function. It is released from the nerve terminals into the hypophysial-portal circulation in a pulsatile manner and, at pituitary level, it interacts with high-affinity, G protein-coupled receptors located at the surface of gonadotrope cells. Binding of GnRH to its receptor results in the activation of several intracellular systems involving multiple G protein mediated signal transduction pathways to regulate in an integrated manner the synthesis and release of gonadotropins !!!REFs!!!. The present studies were undertaken to examine the effect of Co-GnRH on LH release, inositol phosphates formation and cAMP production in pig anterior pituitary cells in vitro and to compare this with the action of the native GnRH.  Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a cytokine that has a number of central effects such as fever, anorexia, analgesia, etc. !!!REF!!!. One of the most important actions involving the neuroendocrine system is its stimulatory effect on the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis !!!REF!!!. The secretion of corticosterone that is the ultimate end point of HPA activation is brought about by an increase in the secretion of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. CRH acts on corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary to increase the secretion of Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which acts on the adrenal cortex to increase corticosterone !!!REF!!!. The CRH neurons that are responsible for HPA activation are concentrated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, with their terminals located in the median eminence (ME) !!!REF!!!. Among the various neurotransmitters that can influence these neurons, the catecholamines, norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) are believed to be crucial factors !!!REF!!!. NE is believed to stimulate CRH secretion !!!REF!!!. Injections of NE into the PVN are known to cause an increase in HPA activation !!!REF!!!. The PVN also receives rich noradrenergic innervation from the brain stem !!!REF!!! and lesioning of the ventral noradrenergic bundle (VNAB) that carries noradrenergic fibers to the hypothalamus has caused a reduction in ACTH secretion !!!REF!!!. Moreover, usage of noradrenergic depletors has caused marked decreases in corticosterone secretion !!!REF!!!. All these studies prove that NE is critical for HPA activation. In contrast to NE, the role of DA is controversial !!!REF!!!. IL-1 most likely affects CRH neurons in the hypothalamus to stimulate the HPA axis. The exact mechanism by which IL-1 does this is unclear. Since CRH perikarya are concentrated within the PVN of the hypothalamus, there is a good possibility that IL-1 may act at the level of this nucleus. In fact, IL-1 receptors have been identified in endothelial cells within the PVN !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, IL-1 could also act at the level of CRH terminals to stimulate the secretion of this hormone. But it is not clear if NE is needed to stimulate CRH perikarya in the PVN or to stimulate CRH release from nerve terminals located in the median eminence !!!REF!!!. Previously, we have shown that IL-1β can stimulate the release of NE within the PVN !!!REF!!!. However, it is not clear if IL-1 can influence NE activity both at the level of CRH cell bodies and terminals simultaneously to stimulate CRH secretion. This study was, therefore, performed using a novel technique that involved the implantation of two cannulae, one in the PVN and the other in the ME. Push–pull perfusion was performed at both sites simultaneously to measure the effect of IL-1 on NE release in these two areas.  α-Synuclein is a neuronal protein involved in several neurodegenerative disorders !!!REF!!!, which are now defined as synucleinopathies. These include neurological diseases that share a few pathological features consisting of aggregates of both normal and altered α-synuclein within specific neuronal populations and glia. The prototype of synucleinopathies is represented by Parkinson's disease (PD) in which α-synuclein is identified as a constant component of neuronal pale eosinophilic inclusions. These inclusions, originally described by Friedrich Lewy in 1912 !!!REFs!!! and named Lewy bodies, occur also in Lewy body dementia. However, the presence of α-synuclein is not restricted to this type of inclusions and the term “synucleinopathies” applies to a variety of disorders which do not feature Lewy bodies. In fact, α-synuclein aggregates are found as glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy !!!REF!!!. In addition, α-synuclein aggregates may occur in motor neuron disease, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, progressive sopranuclear palsy, Down's syndrome, Guam parkinsonism-dementia complex, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, ataxia-telangiectasia, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type I, Huntington's disease and others !!!REFs!!!. The presence of α-synuclein aggregates in these disorders suggests that this protein is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Within this context one should expect that an altered protein may cause the disease itself. In line with this hypothesis, it is interesting to analyse inherited cases of PD, a degenerative movement disorder characterized by massive decrease of dopamine (DA) containing neurons of the substantia nigra and loss of DA innervation in the basal ganglia !!!REF!!!. In the late 1990s it was found that punctiform missense mutations of the gene coding for α-synuclein were responsible for an altered structure of the protein which leads to inherited parkinsonism !!!REFs!!!. However, in keeping with inherited parkinsonism related to the α-synuclein gene, recent epidemiological and neurogenetic studies led to unexpected conclusions. In fact, humans bearing a triplication of the normal α-synuclein gene and producing a mere overexpression of the normal protein were affected by a most severe inherited parkinsonism !!!REFs!!!. Altogether, these genetic studies on various types of α-synuclein-related PD suggest that α-synuclein may be relevant per se to cause this movement disorder either being present in normal amount with an altered structure, or being overexpressed with a normal conformation. This concept moves the analysis toward the processing of α-synuclein as likely critical step for DA neurons of the substantia nigra, since, as shown by Singleton et al. !!!REF!!! and Farrer et al. !!!REF!!!, the mere crowding of normal molecules of α-synuclein leads to DA neuronal death. In keeping with this, one might hypothesize that in sporadic forms of PD even normal α-synuclein expressed in normal amount might become neurotoxic when the condition of DA cells leads to non-genetic structural alterations. Alternatively, specific environmental agents affecting DA neurons may produce an overexpression of α-synuclein, which albeit non-genetically determined, is supposed to sort comparable effects (e.g., DA cell death). This would explain why α-synuclein is constantly present in neuronal inclusions in sporadic PD although the gene is present in normal structure and amount. Our group recently demonstrated that widely abused drugs belonging to the class of amphetamine derivatives (e.g., methamphetamine, METH, and 3,4-methyledioxymethamphetamine, MDMA), which are known to damage the nigrostriatal DA pathway, are also responsible for the occurrence of neuronal inclusions in DA-containing neurons in vivo and in vitro !!!REFs!!!. Occurrence of neuronal inclusions and DA denervation leads to bridging amphetamines toxicity and degenerative disorders. This becomes more likely considering that amphetamines-induced intracellular bodies, as occurs for Lewy bodies in PD, feature the presence of ubiquitin and α-synuclein !!!REFs!!!. On the basis of the neurotoxic role of enhanced expression of α-synuclein in humans, and the occurrence of α-synuclein aggregates following administration of amphetamines, we investigated in the present study: whether amphetamine derivatives increase the expression of α-synuclein within the substantia nigra; whether this effect was specific for the substantia nigra pars compacta; the co-localization of increased α-synuclein within DA neurons projecting to the neostriatum.  There are many indications that a variety of stressors may elicit marked heterogeneity in neuronal, neuroendocrine, and behavioral responses !!!REFs!!!. Neuronal responses can be demonstrated under different conditions by monitoring Fos expression, as a general cytochemical indicator of the neuron activation, in different brain regions !!!REFs!!!. In the nervous tissue, the basal level of Fos expression is low but several types of stimulants including immobilization !!!REF!!!, formalin induced pain, insulin induced hypoglycemia, cold exposure !!!REFs!!!, hemorrhage !!!REF!!!, and audiogenic stress paradigms, fever induced by endotoxin administration !!!REF!!!, and application of different biologically active substances !!!REFs!!! have been shown to be able to turn on Fos expression in many areas of the brain. Although, the hypothalamus is only a small brain area, it contains a number of cell aggregations of neuroendocrine significance, which are activated during different experimental paradigms. Many recent studies have signaled that Fos activation of neurons in the brain might be stimulus-dependent !!!REFs!!!. Especially, the neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, which possess extensive connections with many brain areas and play an unique role in the control of both neuroendocrine and autonomic systems, are promptly activated by a variety of experimental paradigms !!!REFs!!!. Identification of the phenotypic nature of activated neurons and their exact topographical localization are of general interest. However, many studies concern mainly rats and less attention has been given to mouse. Recently, we have shown in mouse !!!REF!!! that substantially different physiological stimuli, i.e. osmotic (hypertonic saline injection) and physical (immobilization) ones, elicit different effects on the activity of neurons in the brainstem autonomic centers which are functionally tightly related to many hypothalamic areas. The intent of the present experiments was to extend our previous study and perform a mapping of Fos expression in different hypothalamic structures of mouse in response to the above mentioned osmotic and non-osmotic experimental conditions. Especially, stimulus-dependent differences in the activation of vasopressinergic, oxytocinergic, and tyrosine hydroxylase cell phenotypes were monitored in selected hypothalamic nuclei. The chemical nature of activated neurons was determined by double-labeling Fos-immunohistochemistry with AVP, OXY, and TH specific antibodies. The double-labeling was performed on the serial coronal sections alternately collected from the whole hypothalamus and evaluated with the help of a computerized Leica DMLS light microscope.  Drug discrimination procedures provide an effective approach for studying the mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs in laboratory animals; thanks to their robustness, sensitivity, and pharmacological selectivity !!!REF!!!. Typically, animals are trained to emit one response (i.e., pressing one lever) after they receive a reference drug and another response (pressing a different lever) after they receive the drug vehicle. After the animals acquire the discrimination, they can be tested with novel drugs to assess the degree of similarity between the test drug(s) and the training drug. The effects of the drug serve as a cue to the animals as to which of the two responses is the appropriate one to emit. The discriminative stimulus effects of drugs are thought to reflect their interceptive or internal stimulus effects. Furthermore, it is widely assumed that the discriminative stimulus properties of drugs in laboratory animals parallel their subjective effects in humans !!!REFs!!!. The involvement of a particular neurotransmitter system in the discriminative effects of a drug can be assessed in several ways; for example, by testing for generalization to a known receptor agonist that is thought to have effects similar to the training drug, or by testing the effects of a known receptor antagonist in combination with the training drug. Thus, drug discrimination procedures can also provide useful information regarding the type of receptor that mediates stimulus control of behavior by drugs from various pharmacological classes !!!REFs!!!. Psychomotor stimulants can function as discriminative stimuli !!!REF!!!. It is now well documented that the dopaminergic system plays a pivotal role in mediating the discriminative stimulus effects of psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate !!!REFs!!!. The behavioral stimulant and mildly reinforcing effects of caffeine also have been well documented !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it is not surprising that caffeine has discriminative stimulus properties in common with psychostimulant drugs. Rats trained to discriminate between saline and either -amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cathinone generalize partially to caffeine !!!REFs!!! and rats trained to discriminate between saline and caffeine generalize partially or completely to -amphetamine, cocaine, and methylphenidate, depending upon the training dose !!!REFs!!!. These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that dopamine systems play a role in mediating the behavioral stimulant effects of caffeine !!!REF!!!. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist at adenosine receptors !!!REF!!! .The A2A-adenosine receptor appears to have a negative modulatory effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission; therefore, blockade of this receptor can enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, caffeine induces dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, an effect seemingly mediated by A1-adenosine receptors !!!REF!!!. In behavioral studies, the locomotor-stimulant effect of caffeine is reduced by blockade of dopamine synthesis with alpha-methyl--tyrosine !!!REFs!!! or by blockade of dopamine receptors with dopamine D1 or D2 receptor-family antagonists !!!REF!!!. Moreover, caffeine potentiates the locomotor-stimulant effects of the indirectly acting dopaminergic agonists amphetamine !!!REFs!!!, methamphetamine !!!REF!!!, and cocaine !!!REF!!! and the dopamine precursor l-dopa !!!REFs!!!. Thus, the effects of caffeine on dopaminergically mediated neurotransmission might be the basis for the commonalities in the discriminative effects of caffeine and psychomotor stimulant drugs. Commonalities in the neural substrates mediating the actions of two drugs also can be revealed by the development of cross tolerance between drugs !!!REF!!!. Rats trained to discriminate between saline and 30mg/kg caffeine developed tolerance to the discriminative effects of caffeine when they were given twice daily injections of 30mg/kg caffeine for 3.5 days; they also were cross tolerant to the caffeine-like discriminative effects of methylphenidate !!!REF!!!. The present study was performed to extend observations on caffeine-induced cross tolerance to discriminative effects of psychomotor stimulant drugs in order to assess further the role of dopaminergic mechanisms shared by caffeine and other drugs that act via dopaminergic systems. Rats were trained to discriminate between 1.0mg/kg -amphetamine and saline. They were tested for stimulus generalization to four drugs, each of which interacts in a unique way with dopaminergic systems: -amphetamine (dopamine releaser), methylphenidate (dopamine uptake inhibitor), SKF 81297 (dopamine D1 receptor agonist), and -(−)-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) (dopamine D2 receptor agonist). Upon completion of the stimulus-generalization curve, 30mg/kg caffeine was administered twice daily for 3.5 days, after which the stimulus-generalization curve for each drug was re-determined; caffeine-induced cross tolerance to the test drug was assessed by determining if the ED50 of the drug had increased significantly after caffeine administration.  That the neurotransmitter acetylcholine plays an important role in memory is demonstrated by the effect of cholinergic blocking agents such as scopolamine on the ability of human volunteers to acquire new information !!!REFs!!!. In addition, degeneration of the cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain to the neocortex and hippocampus is correlated with memory decline in Alzheimer's disease !!!REFs!!!. However, these findings do not necessarily indicate a role for the basal forebrain cholinergic system in memory since scopolamine acts on all cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the brain (and elsewhere) and non-cholinergic pathology in Alzheimer's disease is also correlated with cognitive decline !!!REFs!!!. The basal forebrain cholinergic system consists of several subdivisions !!!REF!!!, of which the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB) which projects to the hippocampal formation, and the basal nucleus of Meynert (NBM) which projects to the neocortex, are potentially the most important for memory. There have been extensive studies of the functions of the basal forebrain in rodents but only those reporting immunotoxic lesions confined to the NBM are relevant to an understanding of the function of the cholinergic cells of the NBM since other lesion techniques lack biochemical specificity !!!REF!!!. Of the studies using immunotoxins, several have not found effects on learning tasks but this does not necessarily mean that the cholinergic NBM system is not involved in memory at all. It could be that inappropriate tasks were used or that the lesion was inadequate. Immunotoxic lesions of the septal area (which includes the VDB) have produced impairments on, for example, the radial arm maze task !!!REF!!!, which match the impairments produced by lesions within the hippocampus !!!REF!!!, the target area for septal cholinergic projections. Immunotoxic lesions of the NBM in rats do not produce impairments on this radial arm maze task !!!REF!!!, but this is hardly surprising since the NBM does not project to the hippocampus. Lesions confined to parts of the neocortex in rodents provide less guidance as to which learning tasks to use in NBM lesion studies. Nonetheless, immunotoxic lesions of the cholinergic NBM neurones have been found to produce impairment on some learning tasks !!!REFs!!!. There are also reports that such lesions affect non-mnemonic performance tasks, e.g. the five-choice serial reaction time task, which may be sensitive to aspects of attention !!!REF!!!, but this does not preclude a contribution to memory since the functions of the neocortex encompass perception, attention and memory. There are a number of ways in which the cholinergic NBM neurones may be involved in cognitive processes. They may, for example, underpin a particular mental process such as acquisition of memories, or selective attention. Alternatively, the cholinergic NBM projections may contribute to activity within a particular anatomical area which, in turn, may undertake many processes within a particular domain, e.g. visual analysis, including perception, attention, memory, etc. In either of these cases, it would be appropriate to consider the involvement of the cholinergic NBM projections in relation to the functions of their target areas across the neocortex. The mnemonic functions of the neocortex are better understood in primates than in rodents because of the many cortical ablation studies in primates using tasks presented in the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus !!!REF!!!. This facilitates the investigation of lesions of the cholinergic projections to the cortex in primates. To our knowledge, our laboratory is the only one to investigate the mnemonic effects of immunotoxic lesions confined to the NBM in monkeys. In the original analyses of all the experiments reviewed here, monkeys with NBM lesions were significantly impaired on some but not all of the visual discrimination tasks on which they were tested. On the remaining tasks learning was often slower but the difference from controls was not significant, leading to the impression that the learning impairments produced by NBM lesions were not particularly severe or sustained. In the current analysis, data have been averaged across all visual discrimination tasks in each study, including individual tasks in which no significant group differences had been found. We also present new data on the effect of this lesion on learning a difficult concurrent visual discrimination reward association task.  Evidence from the literature suggests that exposure to persistently high levels of corticosterone or repeated exposure to stressors present adverse effects on various brain regions, especially the hippocampus !!!REFs!!!. These hormones exacerbate the toxicity of other insults, possibly accelerating the decline in ATP levels in neurons during periods of increased energy demand !!!REFs!!!. For example, acute, short exposure to glucocorticoids can significantly exacerbate postischemic outcome !!!REFs!!!. Ischemia is defined as a severe reduction or complete blockage of blood flow !!!REF!!!, and is a pathophysiological event that frequently results in cerebral damage. Therefore, when higher glucocorticoid levels are combined with ischemia, there is an aggravation in cell loss caused by in vitro !!!REF!!! or in vivo models of ischemia !!!REFs!!!. In addition, synaptic function along with cellular integrity can be preserved after hypoxia–ischemia by preventing the rise in corticosteroid levels by the use of the steroid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone !!!REFs!!! or by adrenalectomy !!!REFs!!!. Most of the available studies concerning the effects of glucocorticoids on ischemic events have used acute administration of, or in vitro exposure to these hormones !!!REFs!!!, or reduced glucocorticoid release by the use of synthesis inhibitors or adrenalectomy !!!REFs!!!. Chronic treatment with glucocorticoids has been shown to have different effects on ischemia-induced neuronal damage in hippocampus; some behavioral and histological studies have observed aggravated damage !!!REFs!!!, while others suggest a reduction in brain damage following hypoxia–ischemia !!!REFs!!!. Chronic exposure to stressors, however, presents several different aspects in relation to chronic administration of glucocorticoids: first, it is well known that repeated exposure to the same stressor can lead to a process of adaptation to that stimulus !!!REFs!!!. Accordingly, it is important to note that the levels of corticosterone observed following acute restraint stress are higher than those that follow the same restraint when repeated several times !!!REF!!!. Secondly, besides releasing glucocorticoids, the stress response involves a large number of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and neuromodulators in various brain regions (for a review see !!!REF!!!). Damage induced by both procedures, stress and ischemia has been suggested to be due, at least in part, to increased glutamatergic tonus !!!REFs!!!. In such a situation, transporter proteins which uptake glutamate play an important role in the termination of glutamatergic neurotransmission and prevention of excitotoxicity !!!REF!!!. Our hypothesis is that the exposure to stress will possibly increase susceptibility to ischemic injury. Both acute and intermittent stress will be used, since adaptation to stress may lead to a different outcome in this condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the consequences of acute or repeated exposure to restraint stress on cellular function after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of hypoxic–ischemic events !!!REFs!!!, in rat hippocampal slices. This structure was chosen since it is one of the most important brain structures mediating the stress response !!!REFs!!!, being also a region particularly sensitive to stress effects, as mentioned earlier (e.g. !!!REF!!!). We also evaluated glutamate uptake by hippocampal slices from rats subjected to repeated exposure to restraint stress, and sacrificed 24h afterwards, when these slices were exposed to OGD conditions.  Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder worldwide. Over excitation of excitatory amino acids is commonly accepted mechanism for the genesis of epilepsy !!!REF!!!. Although the contribution of mitochondrial functions to epileptic seizures is unknown, epileptic seizures may occur as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. Probably, mitochondrial oxidative stress and resultant dysfunction is one of the important mechanisms underlying certain seizure disorders !!!REF!!!. The activation of excitatory amino acid receptor can also trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These increased ROS not only causes long-lasting seizure formation, but if not arrested, can lead to neuronal death !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, the consequence of many experimental studies demonstrated that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction occur as a consequence of prolonged epileptic seizures, suggested this idea which oxidative stress may play an important role in seizure-induced brain damage !!!REFs!!!. In various experimental studies it has been demonstrated that the use of antioxidants could be a potential approach both in arresting or inhibiting the seizure genesis by ameliorating the excitotoxicity, and in preventing neurotoxicity by inhibiting ROS production !!!REFs!!!. For that reason, we used erdosteine, a new homocysteine-derived expectorant, which its metabolites can act as a free radical scavenger !!!REF!!!, for the inhibition of convulsions and the attenuation of oxidative brain damage in PTZ-induced seizure model in mice.  The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a necessary and unavoidable consequence of aerobic metabolism. In response to acute or single bout of exercise, the body cannot adapt to the oxidative challenge because of the shortness of exercise duration and the physiological demands of intensity. Physical exercise under these conditions generates increased levels of ROS, and results in oxidative damage to macromolecules !!!REFs!!!. Regular exercise, however, through its continuous radical generating effect, can also significantly contribute to the oxidative status !!!REFs!!!. The most marked effect of regular exercise is that it causes adaptation to the exercise-induced oxidative stress. Regular exercise has been shown to increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, indicating that the oxidative stress-related adaptation takes place also in the brain !!!REF!!!. In addition it may lead to muscle hypertrophy, better cardiac function, lower resting heart rate, improved glucose uptake, and better endurance !!!REF!!!. Accumulating evidence suggests that physical exercise has the capability to beneficially effect certain brain functions !!!REF!!!. It has also been shown that voluntary running increases the number of new hippocampal cells !!!REF!!!, brain plasticity !!!REF!!!, i.e. exercise can stimulate neurogenesis, increase resistance to brain insult and improve learning and mental performance !!!REF!!!. It appears that voluntary physical exercise increases the production of trophic factors in the brain, which is associated with improved memory and learning !!!REFs!!!, and long-term potentiation !!!REF!!!. Neurotrophins elicit structural and physiological changes, and regulate gene expression in the neurons. There is an immediate answer in neurotrophin transcription to a number of changes occurring in brain functions. Neurotrophins themselves are involved in regulating their own expression !!!REFs!!!. According to our knowledge, at least two major neurotrophins play crucial roles in brain function related to exercise: the brain derived neurotrophin (BDNF), and the nerve growth factor (NGF). Besides exercise, diet also has a significant effect on brain function !!!REF!!!. Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) leaf has a long history as a herbal remedy, and nutritious addition to the diet !!!REF!!!. Nettle is rich in minerals (especially iron), vitamin C and pro-vitamin A !!!REF!!!. Previous studies show that nettle leaves are a good source of essential amino acids !!!REF!!!, ascorbic acid !!!REF!!!, rare carbohydrates !!!REF!!!, and several mineral elements. It is also known that nettle has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressive, and anti-rheumatoid effect !!!REFs!!!. Epidemiological and laboratory studies indicate that carotinoids (pro-vitamin A) may have anti-carcinogenic !!!REF!!!, anti-ulcer !!!REF!!! or anti-ageing properties !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of regular exercise, nettle supplementation and their additive influence on brain reactions to oxidative stress and on several markers of brain function, such as the transcription of inflammatory factors and neurotrophin production.  Studies have demonstrated dissociations among contributions of different medial temporal lobe structures to learning about object identity, stimulus valence and spatial relationships !!!REFs!!!. For example, the perirhinal cortex is important for perception and memory of object features and identity but not spatial arrangements !!!REFs!!!. However, perirhinal cortex lesions can lead to subtle deficits in memory for spatial locations. This may occur because perirhinal lesions lead to impaired processing of stimulus identity information, which normally makes a non-essential contribution to solving a task that requires the formation of relationships among these cues !!!REFs!!!. The amygdala is important for associating objects or spatial relationships with positive or aversive outcomes !!!REFs!!!, but is unnecessary for remembering object identity or spatial relationships !!!REFs!!!. The hippocampus is often involved in long-term memory for spatial relationships, but not object identity !!!REFs!!!. It is also postulated to be essential for relational learning, or creating a flexible representation of relationships among multiple elements that can be regarded as combined elements or as individual elements simultaneously !!!REFs!!!. Spatial navigation tasks, such as the Morris water task, are often relational in nature because successful performance requires that the spatial cues be represented flexibly, both individually and in the context of all other cues !!!REFs!!!. Studies of dissociations among medial temporal lobe structures, such as those cited above, often entail comparisons among relational spatial tasks versus simple associations with objects, and general distinctions are drawn between memory for spatial arrangements and objects. However, the perirhinal cortex and amygdala are not believed to specifically play a role in relational memory, and conversely the hippocampus is thought to be essential for remembering relational information and not simple associations regardless of whether or not the information is spatial in nature !!!REFs!!!. Thus, it is possible that the object-spatial dissociations among medial temporal lobe structures are due to the relational nature of the spatial tasks versus the non-relational nature of the object tasks. We predicted that perirhinal- and amygdala-damaged animals would perform poorly on a relational memory task that requires associations to be made among object identity and passively/classically-acquired stimulus valence, respectively. That is, although relational memory binding should be intact in these animals, it would not be possible to form relational representations based on object identity or stimulus valence, if these systems are disrupted. Relational representation of actively/operantly-acquired spatial associations, however, should remain intact because these can be formed via other systems. We compared performance of rats with different medial temporal lobe lesions on a standard control relational task, the actively-acquired spatial Morris water task, to a passively-acquired relational object preference task. For the relational object task, rats were exposed to two sets of different objects without access to distal cues. One set contained taller glass objects, and the other contained shorter metal objects. Both sets of objects were placed in the same fixed spatial arrangement. One set of objects always contained food scattered among the objects, and the other set was never paired with food. The rats, therefore, experienced all the elements from many different angles and vantage points while collecting food and were hence unlikely to be able to solve the task using a non-relational strategy, such as creating a rigid representation of all the cues as observed from one vantage point. Although a seemingly simple solution to the task was remembering that one set of objects was made of metal and one was made of glass, or that one set was taller than the other, this type of categorization would likely require a relational representation. Extracting the commonality that all objects made of the same material, or of similar height, were paired with food would entail remembering the properties of one object paired with food and comparing it to those of all the other objects paired with food simultaneously. This would require an abstract extrapolation for the rats, since the automatic over-learned semantic categories used by humans, such as glass, metal, tall and shorter are likely unavailable to the rats. In other words, humans have already consolidated relevant higher order semantic categorization strategies that can be used as an alternative to forming new long-term relational memory representations. In order to use a similar strategy, rats would have to create these semantic groupings, which would require the formation of a new relational representation. Therefore, a relational strategy would be necessary to solve this task. The current relational object preference task is hence quite similar to the Morris water task, and requires the formation of a similar type of relational representation. The object preference task requires the formation of an association between food (reward) and objects viewed from different vantage points, just as the Morris water task requires the formation of an association between escape (reward) and spatial cues viewed from different vantage points. We expected normal rats to develop a preference for the set of objects paired with food and to learn the location of the hidden platform on the Morris water task, as they have the ability to form passively and actively acquired relational representations composed of objects or spatial arrangements. Perirhinal lesions would likely lead to failure on the object preference task with unaffected Morris water task performance, due to abnormalities in learning about object identity but not spatial arrangements. However, subtle deficits on the probe trial of the Morris water task were expected due to a loss of stimulus identity information, as reported in previous studies !!!REFs!!!. We expected that amygdala damage would impair performance on the object preference task, with intact Morris water task performance, due to abnormalities in acquiring associations between stimuli and a salient event in a passive acquisition classical conditioning setting. The possibility of whether Morris water task probe trial performance would be affected by the loss of valence information associated with the platform location remained to be explored. Finally, we expected that hippocampal damage would cause impairments in spatial relational Morris water task performance, as reported previously !!!REFs!!!. We also expected rats with hippocampal lesions to show impaired performance on the relational object preference task since they would be unable to form a relational representation to solve the task. Because rats were forced to navigate through the environment, they would be unable to blend all the stimuli into a non-relational rigid representation viewed from one vantage point. Thus, they have no available viable strategy for solving this task. Support for our hypotheses would suggest that discrete dissociations among medial temporal lobe regions for different types of information processing might be an oversimplification.  Our previous work demonstrated that prenatal morphine exposure twice daily during gestational days 11–18 differentially alters male and female sexual behavior !!!REFs!!!. It increases copulatory activities in male rats, but reduces receptive and proceptive components of sexual behavior of female rats to the mounting attempts of stimulus males !!!REFs!!!. It is well-established that the presence of gonadal steroids during early development leads to sexual dimorphism in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult rodents !!!REF!!!. Gender-specific morphological and neurochemical differences in the hypothalamus are known to underlie gender differences in adult sexual behaviors and endocrine responses to gonadal steroids !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, sexual dimorphism in the density of hypothalamic μ-opioid receptors has also been reported, and it is dependent on the presence or absence of androgens at the time of birth !!!REFs!!!. However, the mechanism(s) through which prenatal morphine exposure influences male and female sexual behavior is not yet established. One possible way that prenatal morphine exposure may affect adult sexual behaviors is via altering μ-opioid receptor density in brain regions associated with reproductive functions !!!REFs!!!, such as the hypothalamus and preoptic area. Our previous homogenate binding study !!!REF!!! demonstrated that prenatal morphine exposure has long-term effects on the binding characteristics of hypothalamic μ-opioid receptors. Specifically, prenatal morphine exposure decreases the number of binding sites ( max) of μ-opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and preoptic area in male rats and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats, and increases the max of μ-opioid receptors in the hypothalamus of OVX, estrogen-treated female rats. However, prenatal morphine exposure does not alter either the binding capacity or the affinity ( d) of ligand binding to μ-opioid receptors of adult male rats. The present study utilized receptor autoradiography to visualize with anatomical precision the effects of prenatal morphine exposure on μ-opioid receptor density in specific hypothalamic nuclei that are involved in male and female sexual behavior including the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), medial preoptic area (mPOA), and arcuate nucleus (ARC) of adult male and female rats. The VMH is a brain region that plays a role in motivated behaviors and is an important nucleus for controlling female sexual behavior !!!REFs!!!. The mPOA was examined, because of its importance in male sexual behavior !!!REFs!!!. Further, the ARC and mPOA controls estrous cyclicity in female rats !!!REF!!! that has been shown to be disrupted by chronic morphine administration !!!REFs!!!. Thus, all of these brain areas could potentially be involved in the naturally motivating adult male and female sexual behaviors that is altered by prenatal morphine exposure as demonstrated in our previous works !!!REFs!!!. Gonadally intact males displayed enhanced copulatory activities and gonadectomized, hormone replaced females exhibited inhibited receptive and proceptive responses to stimulus animals !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, the present study investigated whether the changes seen in sexual behaviors of morphine-exposed male and female rats may correlate with changes in μ-opioid receptor density in brain regions associated with these behaviors.  It is well known that the adult mammalian brain continuously generates new neurons, which are produced in two regions of active proliferation: the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricle and the innermost region of the hippocampal dentate granular layer, known as the subgranular zone (SGZ) !!!REFs!!!. In the dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis has been observed throughout the adult life of animals of different species and after different experimental manipulations !!!REF!!!. Recent studies have shown that some neurological insults or stimulants such as transient global ischemia !!!REFs!!!, epilepsy induced by kainic acid injection !!!REF!!!, pilocarpine administration !!!REFs!!! or electrical kindling !!!REF!!! result in increased proliferation of these neural precursors in the adult rat hippocampus. Although the functional meaning of neurogenesis is essentially unknown, the production of neural cells as a consequence of direct hippocampal distress suggests that they may be involved in repair as well as in normal adaptive responses to the insults. The elucidation of the cellular types, the degree and the conditions of differentiation of these new cells from endogenous neural precursors may permit the development of neuronal replacement therapies for neurodegenerative diseases and other CNS injuries as an alternative to the transplantation of exogenous cells. Trimethyltin (TMT) is an organotin compound with potent neurotoxicant effects. This substance is regarded as being particularly useful for studying the response to injury on account of the distinct pattern of degeneration it causes in rodent brain. In particular, the rat hippocampus constitutes the most suitable model for TMT-induced brain injury. TMT-induced neurodegeneration is characterized by massive neuronal death, mainly localized in the limbic system, especially in the hippocampus, accompanied by reactive gliosis, epilepsy and marked neurobehavioral alterations, and is considered a useful model of neurodegeneration and selective neuronal death !!!REFs!!!. The mechanisms by which TMT induces degeneration are still not understood, but glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity has been proposed as the main candidate, although other mechanisms cannot be discarded !!!REF!!!. The possibility that TMT-induced neurodegeneration affects endogenous neurogenesis in this well-characterized model has been investigated in mice !!!REF!!!, which exhibit a peculiar neuropathological pattern, with an essentially acute lesion (24–72h) that directly affects DG granule cells, while in the rat it is progressive, developing over 3 weeks, and is restricted to CA pyramidal neurons !!!REFs!!!. The present study investigates the effects of TMT on the proliferation of neural precursors in the hippocampus of the adult rat, using the systemic administration of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells in the S-phase of the mitotic cycle. The temporal expression, type and differentiation features of newborn cells were analyzed by conventional and confocal microscopy.  The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) belong to the large super family of ligand-gated ion channels and are expressed throughout both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in non-neuronal cells (reviewed by !!!REF!!!). To date, 12 distinct genes encoding neuronal nAChR subunits have been identified, 9 α-type (α2–α10) and 3 β-type (β2–β4), generating an abundance of structurally and functionally distinct hetero- and homo-pentameric receptors (reviewed by !!!REF!!!). The neuronal nAChRs mediate the effects of the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and are the principal biological targets of the tobacco alkaloid, nicotine. Nicotine has diverse effects on the nervous system, altering behavior and cognition !!!REF!!!, inducing seizures !!!REF!!!, mediating analgesia !!!REF!!! and regulating autonomic functions !!!REFs!!!. Nicotine also elicits changes in core body temperature. Early experiments demonstrated the induction of a hypothermic response following intracerebral nicotine administration in cats !!!REF!!!, monkeys !!!REFs!!! and rats !!!REF!!!. The significant tolerance to the hypothermic effects of an acute nicotine challenge following chronic systemic nicotine infusion in mice !!!REFs!!! as well as reported time and dose dependencies, support a receptor mediated process !!!REFs!!!. While the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian thermoregulation are largely unknown, data suggest that nicotine-induced alterations in body temperature are influenced by genetic factors. Differential sensitivity to dose dependent nicotine-induced hypothermia and acute tolerance has been identified in different strains of inbred mice !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, the missense mutation A529T identified in the murine α4 nAChR subunit gene was associated with increased sensitivity to various effects of nicotine, including nicotine-induced hypothermia !!!REFs!!!. A recent study in knockout mice deficient in the β2 nAChR subunit reported a reduced hypothermic response to low doses of nicotine, suggesting that this subunit partially mediates nicotine-induced hypothermia !!!REF!!!. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possible involvement of various neuronal nAChR subunit genes in temperature homeostasis and in nicotine-induced hypothermia using mutant mice deficient for α7, α5 or β4 subunits (α7−/−, α5−/− and β4−/−, respectively). Significant alterations in both baseline core body temperature and in the hypothermic response normally induced by nicotine were observed in mice deficient in the β4 subunit gene, suggesting that this nAChR subunit plays an important role in mammalian core body temperature homeostasis and in the mediation of nicotine-induced temperature changes.  In recent years, the Göttingen miniature pig (minipig) and other strains of domestic pig have been used as experimental models for brain imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET). The mapping of radiotracer uptake and binding by PET provides the basis for functional and physiological analysis of living brain, but anatomical detail in PET images is degraded due to poor spatial resolution of the tomograph. Furthermore, focal changes in tracer uptake cannot readily be ascribed to physiological changes in specific anatomical structures. To date, anatomical regions of interest have generally been defined manually on the PET images of pig brain !!!REFs!!! or in magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained for individual animals, to which the positron emission recordings have been co-registered !!!REFs!!!. However, for practical reasons, MR images of individual pigs are not always available. Spatial normalization of PET images to a standard, statistically defined coordinate system, as developed previously for the human brain !!!REFs!!!, and more recently for non-human primates !!!REFs!!! could obviate the need for MR images of individual pigs. Statistical parametric maps of altered regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or other physiological parameters in human brain can be produced using statistical packages, such as DOT !!!REF!!! or SPM99 !!!REF!!!. However, these software packages were developed specifically for use with the Talairach stereotaxic coordinates of human brain, and cannot co-register or normalize brain images obtained from other species. In the SPM approach, individual human MR images are co-registered to an MRI atlas calculated from the co-registration of a large series of MR images obtained in normal human subjects !!!REFs!!!. This normative brain atlas serves as a template in which the normalized and standard stereotaxic coordinate system is defined. Consequently, the effects of pharmacological treatment, a physiological stimulus, or an effect of specific pathophysiology on the parametric maps can be calculated using a voxel-by-voxel analysis across subjects, always with reference to the common MR template. This principle has recently been applied to the mapping of baseline CBF in brain of living baboons !!!REF!!!. In order to make possible the use of this approach in pig studies, we proposed to define a stereotaxic space and a standard MRI template for pig brain. In order to accomplish this, we first developed an automated and unbiased method for co-registration of T1-weighted MR brain images obtained from a series of Göttingen minipigs, and then defined a standard stereotaxic coordinate system for the pig brain. This coordinate system now serves in our laboratory as an anatomical reference for the interpretation of receptor binding and pharmacological activation PET studies. We have recently described a probabilistic atlas of gross anatomical structures in the Göttingen minipig brain !!!REF!!!. The gross anatomical structures defined in the probabilistic atlas are used to define volumes of interest in PET scans without the human bias typically introduced by manual identification of regions. Using this atlas, we have employed a volume-of-interest-based approach to quantify the regional effects of the selective neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on markers of dopamine innervation in the pig !!!REFs!!!. In this earlier region of interest (ROI) analysis, the magnitude of regional cerebral blood flow measured with [15O]-water tended to be higher in the MPTP-lesioned group, but this effect did not reach significance in the VOIs examined. This might occur if focal changes in rCBF evoked by previous exposure to MPTP, did not coincide exactly with the position of the statistically defined anatomical ROIs. Therefore, as a test of the utility of the new stereotaxic coordinate system for pig brain, a voxel-by-voxel comparison of CBF maps was employed using the DOT software to produce a -statistical parametric map of the relative changes (ΔrCBF) in the MPTP-lesioned pigs compared to a normal control group.  Circadian rhythms in behavior, physiology, and hormone levels are endogenously driven by a biological pacemaker, and they persist in temporal isolation. Animals entrain, or synchronize, their circadian clocks to the 24-h light:24-h dark cycle because the phase of these rhythms is advanced or delayed in response to environmental time cues. Whereas photic stimuli are of primary importance in the entrainment of circadian rhythms, nonphotic stimuli such as vigorous activity !!!REF!!!, can also reset the phase of the clock (for review, see !!!REF!!!). The primary circadian pacemaker is contained in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus !!!REF!!!. The SCN receives lighting information from the environment through a direct projection from the retina to the SCN, the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) !!!REFs!!!. Glutamate appears to be the primary neurotransmitter that communicates lighting information in the RHT !!!REF!!!. Nonphotic information is communicated to the SCN by at least two pathways: a direct serotonergic pathway from the raphe !!!REFs!!! and the geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT), which projects to the SCN from the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus (IGL) !!!REFs!!!. The primary neurochemical signals in the GHT appear to be neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GABA !!!REF!!!. One of the most abundant neuropeptides found in the brain is NPY !!!REF!!!. NPY has been implicated in the control of many types of phenomena including feeding !!!REF!!!, sexual behavior !!!REFs!!!, stress !!!REF!!!, and anxiety !!!REFs!!!. NPY is also important in the regulation of circadian rhythms and may mediate at least some of the phase shifts induced by nonphotic stimuli during the day !!!REF!!!. Application of NPY to SCN neurons during the day phase advances rhythms in activity in vivo !!!REFs!!! and discharge rates of SCN neurons in vitro !!!REF!!!. During the late night, NPY application inhibits phase advances induced by light, glutamate, or NMDA both in vivo and in vitro !!!REFs!!!. During the early night, however, there have been conflicting reports on whether NPY influences light-induced phase delays !!!REFs!!!. There is some evidence that suggests that NPY may activate different receptor subtypes to induce phase shifts during the day than it does to inhibit light-induced phase shifts during the night. Administration of the Y2 agonist NPY3-36 into the SCN induces phase shifts that are similar to NPY during the day !!!REFs!!!. However, more recent evidence indicates that this agonist can also activate Y5 receptors !!!REF!!!. During the night, the Y1/Y5 selective agonist, (Leu(31), Pro(34))-NPY, was found to inhibit phase advances induced by light in a manner similar to NPY administered in vivo !!!REF!!!. In addition, a more selective Y5 agonist ((Ala 31, Aib32)-NPY; now commercially available) has been shown to inhibit phase delays induced by glutamate administered during the early night in vitro !!!REF!!!. It remains to be determined whether Y5 receptor activation is capable of producing phase shifts during the day or inhibiting light-induced phase advances during the late night. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the effects of NPY on circadian phase at three different circadian times. Specifically, we sought to determine whether activation of Y5-like receptors is sufficient for the inhibition of phase advances induced by light during the late night, and the induction of phase advances during the day. Finally, we also examined the ability of NPY to inhibit light-induced phase delays in the early night. To test the hypothesis that there is a differential sensitivity to NPY in the early versus late night, we compared the effects of three concentrations of NPY to inhibit light-induced phase delays.  Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most ubiquitous neuropeptides in the mammalian brain !!!REF!!!. NPY is involved in several physiological functions such as feeding !!!REF!!!, memory !!!REF!!!, regulation of blood pressure !!!REF!!!, circadian rhythms !!!REF!!!, and possibly sleep–wake regulation. NPY is present in the basal forebrain (BF), an area that plays an important role in the regulation of cortical activation (for a recent review, see !!!REF!!!). The BF contains a heterogeneous population of cholinergic and non-cholinergic (GABAergic, peptidergic, and glutamatergic) corticopetal neurons as well as various types of interneurons containing different peptides, including NPY and somatostatin !!!REF!!!. The role of the NPY containing neurons in the modulation of sleep–wake states and cortical EEG via BF is not fully understood. NPY was found to colocalize with GABA in many forebrain neurons !!!REF!!!. Single NPY neurons can innervate several cholinergic corticopetal neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band !!!REFs!!! and in the substantia innominata !!!REF!!!. NPY containing terminals were shown to form symmetrical synapses with cholinergic neurons !!!REF!!! and are assumed to be inhibitory !!!REF!!!. In anesthetized rats, NPY containing BF neurons represent a subpopulation of S-cells (slow-wave-active cells) !!!REF!!! which are silent during spontaneous or tail pinch-induced cortical activation, but have a higher firing rate during episodes of cortical slow waves. These neurons have been suggested to inhibit cortically projecting cholinergic neurons !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present experiments was to examine the effect of local injection of NPY into the BF by monitoring EEG changes in urethane-anesthetized rats.  Beside the characteristic anterograde episodic memory impairment, deficits of semantic memory are also present at some point during the course of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD). The nature of the semantic deficits has been extensively studied by using different psychophysical and electrophysiological studies !!!REFs!!! and the dysfunction of the temporal neocortex and frontal circuits has been implicated as neuro-anatomical substrates of this pathology. Indeed, physiological measures of memory function can be provided by cognitive event-related potential (ERP) studies. ERP assessments in normal subjects have shown that the waveforms are fractionated into different components by combining the criteria of their stimulus modality, timing, scalp distribution and sensitivity to experimental manipulations. Using these criteria, a number of ERP components have been identified !!!REF!!!. In animal–non-animal semantic categorization tasks the early negative component (N1: 150–250ms) is more negative for non-animal stimuli and probably reflects early perceptual categorization processes !!!REFs!!!. Another ERP component, the N400 has been used in psycholinguistic research as an index of semantic integration (for a review see reference !!!REF!!!). N400 is less negative for words presented after a semantically related context, than after a semantically unrelated milieu. Similar effect was observed in an animal–non-animal categorization task !!!REF!!!. Abnormal N400s were found even in mild AD for semantically unrelated words !!!REFs!!!. The P300 potential, which is linked to the updating of working memory !!!REF!!!, has also been shown to be abnormal in AD !!!REFs!!!. Because of the high temporal resolution, ERPs can be very sensitive markers of the neuronal changes in the brain. Apart from ERPs, impaired cerebral microcirculation and glucose metabolism are early markers of AD !!!REFs!!!. When brain is deprived of glucose, cognitive functions deteriorate. Under certain circumstances (e.g. stress, hypoxia, fasting) ketones and lactate can be metabolized in the brain !!!REF!!! as “alternative fuels”, and they reduce hypoglycemia-associated cerebral dysfunctions in humans !!!REFs!!!. This may also happen in AD. In addition, higher-than-normal lactate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect mitochondrial oxidative damage !!!REF!!!. Being a vasodilator and metabolic intermediary, intravenous sodium-lactate (SL) – precursor of bicarbonate that buffers H+ in serum – could improve cardiac output and cerebral circulation !!!REFs!!! by attenuating acidosis, and therefore might enhance brain function. As such, our study was designed to measure lactate-induced changes in ERPs using an animal–non-animal semantic categorization task.  Pleiotrophin (PTN) is an 18kDa heparin-binding protein that was originally purified from bovine uterus !!!REF!!! and neonatal rat brain !!!REF!!!. It was first classified as a growth/differentiating cytokine with diverse action in cell migration, repair, neurite outgrowth and differentiation !!!REF!!!. Recently it was shown that PTN exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in stem cells !!!REF!!! and embryonic neurons !!!REF!!!. The neurotrophic properties show resemblance to those of the neurotrophins and PTN is now sometimes referred to as heparin-binding neurotrophic factor. Since PTN expression in the brain peaks around birth the growth factor is believed to play important roles during neuronal development. Though more restricted and at lower levels, it is also expressed in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS) !!!REF!!! where its expression has been shown to increase after brain injury !!!REF!!!. The family of neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/neurotrophin-5 (NT-4/5), are well known for their role in neuroprotection !!!REF!!!. In recent years they have received much attention for their role in drug addiction and have arisen as potential candidates for mediating structural changes leading to the development of sensitisation !!!REF!!!. Sensitisation may occur after repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamine or cocaine. The phenomenon develops gradually and has been proposed to involve physical modulation of the structure of neurons and synapses in certain parts of the brain, engaging cellular and molecular processes resembling those of memory acquisition and learning !!!REF!!!. Structural plasticity results in reorganisation of neuronal circuits and changes in synaptic sensitivity by alteration of the number and shape of dendrites and dendritic spines !!!REF!!!. Much research on the topic has been focused on drug-induced changes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) !!!REFs!!!. In particular, drug-induced effects on the expression of different neurotrophins and their effects on dendrites and axonal branching in the CNS have been extensively studied (for reviews see !!!REFs!!!). For example, it has been shown that the level of BDNF is enhanced in the mesolimbic system after cocaine administration !!!REF!!! and that intra-VTA or -NAc injections of BDNF potentiate the locomotor effect of cocaine !!!REF!!!. Neurotrophins may be an important link for the understanding of neuronal plasticity. The observation that PTN shares the effects on cell growth, survival and differentiation with the neurotrophins, raises the question of whether similarities also exist in mediating the action of psychostimulant drugs. Thus, this study was undertaken to examine whether the transcription of PTN is regulated by a single dose of amphetamine. If neurotrophic factors underlie morphological changes leading to the development of behavioural sensitisation, changes in their regulation ought to be detectable already after the first confrontation to the drug. For that reason a study of the acute effect of the drug was chosen. Furthermore, a single dose of amphetamine has also been shown to produce a significant increase in spine density in the NAc !!!REF!!!. It is well documented that the development of behavioural sensitisation depends on the activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors !!!REF!!!, and by blocking this receptor with, for example, the noncompetitive antagonist MK-801, not only behavioural sensitisation but also tolerance and dependence on several drugs of abuse can be hampered. Therefore, a group of animals received a single dose of amphetamine preceded by an injection of MK-801. Amphetamine indeed induced an increase in PTN mRNA in NAc, but in contrast to the expectation, MK-801 pretreatment even further increased the transcription level.  It is now becoming increasingly clear that glia serve a variety of functions in the central nervous system. Their close apposition to neurons and their connections, their ability to respond to neurotransmitters released at synapses and to act as a source of molecules that, in turn, influence neuronal activity, suggests that these cells play an important role in the integrative functions of the brain !!!REFs!!!. Amongst the many biologically active molecules that are, at least in part, derived from glia, are the amino acids arginine, glutamate and glutamine. In eukaryotic cells, arginine is the only physiological substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), thus an adequate supply of the amino acid is an important consideration in ensuring that nitric oxide (NO)-mediated processes occur in an appropriate manner. Arginine cannot be synthesised de novo in the brain because the tissue lacks a complete urea cycle and the enzymes required to convert citrulline to arginine are not always co-localised with NOS !!!REF!!!. Thus, neuronal NO production is dependent, to some extent, on the supply of arginine from another source. Immunocytochemical studies performed on various brain regions have revealed that arginine is located predominantly in astrocytes !!!REFs!!!. Using brain slices and cultured cells, Grima et al. !!!REF!!! have shown that the activation of non--methyl-d-aspartate (non-NMDA) ionotropic glutamate receptors promotes the release of radiolabelled arginine from astrocytes, and that this can be utilised by neurons to synthesise NO. In addition, Vega-Agapito et al. !!!REFs!!! have reported arginine to be released from these cells in response to an NO donor and peroxynitrite. This would suggest that the supply of arginine in the brain may be controlled by both the main activator of NOS, glutamate and its product, NO. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is becoming increasingly clear, however that neurons are not the only source of this amino acid and that glia-derived glutamate also plays an important role in synaptic activity !!!REFs!!!. Studies on cultured and freshly isolated astrocytes have demonstrated that glutamate release from these cells is from vesicular stores !!!REF!!! and can be promoted by NO !!!REFs!!!. Another route by which glia might influence extracellular glutamate levels involves volume-regulated anion channels. Glutamate release via these channels has been demonstrated in the intact brain !!!REF!!! and to be potentiated by peroxynitrite in cultured cells !!!REF!!!. Interestingly, there is evidence that the bulk of the extracellular glutamate measured in vivo may be of glial origin. Baker et al. !!!REF!!! have shown that extracellular glutamate levels in the striatum were reduced markedly by blockade of the cysteine–glutamate antiporter, which appears to be located primarily in glia !!!REFs!!!. Once released at synapses, glutamate is recycled by the glutamate–glutamine cycle. Glutamate is rapidly taken up into surrounding astrocytes where it is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is then released by astrocytes, taken up by neurons and converted back to glutamate via glutaminase !!!REF!!!. This cycle has been shown to occur in the intact brain !!!REF!!! and its importance is highlighted by studies showing that impaired glutamate–glutamine cycling might underlie pathological states such as epilepsy !!!REFs!!! and that it may undergo adaptive changes in response to brain injury !!!REF!!!. Evidence also suggests that glutamine synthetase is a target for acute regulation. McBean et al. !!!REF!!! showed that NMDA receptor activation reduced glutamine synthetase activity in brain slices, and more recently, Kosenko et al. !!!REF!!! reported that whole brain glutamine concentrations were increased upon administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting that these receptors exert tonic inhibitory control over the enzyme. McBean et al. !!!REF!!! also showed that the effect of NMDA was reversed by an inhibitor of NOS. These findings suggest that NO released from neurons may be responsible for regulating glutamine synthetase activity. Support for this has been provided by studies on cultured astrocytes, which show that the enzyme is inhibited by the application of an NO donor !!!REF!!!. Despite the wealth of knowledge about the factors regulating the release of these amino acids, a drawback of the work discussed is that it is often difficult to extrapolate findings from cell culture or other in vitro preparations to the in vivo situation. To address this issue, we undertook an in vivo microdialysis study in freely moving animals to determine the effect of various drugs that stimulate glutamate receptors and/or influence NOS activity on the release of arginine, glutamate and glutamine into the extracellular space.  Talampanel (GYKI-53773, LY-300164), 7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8()-methyl-8,9-dihydro-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h] !!!REFs!!! benzodiazepine is the active (−)-isomer of GYKI-53405. Talampanel acts as a negative allosteric modulator at AMPA subtype of glutamate excitatory amino acid receptors. Its actions are of non-competitive nature !!!REFs!!!. Talampanel is effective in a variety of animal models of seizures. It has been shown to possess anticonvulsant activity in maximal electroshock (MES), pentylenetetrazole, strychnine, bemegride, bicuculline, picrotoxin, nicotine, 3-mercapto-propionic acid and 4-aminopyridine-induced seizures with oral ED50 values between 7.2 and 22.7mg/kg in mice !!!REFs!!!. It also enhances the effects of traditional anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, diazepam and clonazepam) in electrical kindling and MES tests !!!REF!!!. Talampanel is well tolerated in healthy human subjects in a single dose of 100mg !!!REF!!!. In patients with refractory partial seizures talampanel showed efficacy in reducing seizure frequency !!!REF!!!. Talampanel reduced the symptoms of rat experimental encephalomyelitis !!!REFs!!! in a dose of 30mg/kg twice a day over 7 days and reduced the contusion area of the brain in rats after traumatic brain injury in a dose of 4mg/kg/h over 72h !!!REF!!!. In oxotremorine test, which mimics the cholinergic overactivity of Parkinson's disease, talampanel potently mitigated the tremor (ED50 =5.6mg/kg p.o.) !!!REF!!!. 2,3-Benzodiazepines have been shown to be neuroprotective in neuronal cultures exposed to kainate or AMPA !!!REFs!!!. Talampanel attenuated the kainic acid neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal cultures with IC50 =4μM !!!REF!!!. The compound inhibited AMPA-currents in isolated cerebellar Purkinje cells (IC50 =2.5μM in whole cell patch clamp) and blocked AMPA (IC50 =1.7μM) or kainate (IC50 =2.6μM) induced spreading depression in chicken retina !!!REFs!!!. In vivo, talampanel protected neonatal rats against AMPA-induced brain tissue damage and attenuated the turning behavior !!!REF!!!. The role of glutamate receptor activation is crucial in the evolution of ischemic brain damage !!!REF!!!. The excitotoxicity of glutamate is mediated by several glutamate receptor subtypes including the ionotropic -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA receptors. NMDA receptor antagonists seem to be effective against ischemic injury in rodents, only when they are administered before or shortly after the ischemic insult !!!REFs!!!. Non-NMDA receptor antagonists are capable of reducing ischemic neuronal injury even when applied with several hours delay !!!REFs!!! suggesting that non-NMDA mechanisms are involved in the later stage of cellular damage. Buchan and co-workers suggested the AMPA-antagonists rather than the NMDA antagonists to be subjected to clinical stroke trials !!!REF!!!. The neuroprotective effect of the non-competitive AMPA-antagonist GYKI-52466, the precursor of talampanel, was described in both global !!!REF!!! and focal brain ischemia !!!REFs!!!. Lodge et al. studied talampanel in global forebrain ischemia model in gerbils !!!REF!!!. The compound was administered orally and intraperitoneally in a dose of 10mg/kg immediately after bilateral carotid occlusion and repeatedly 1, 2 and 4h later. The treatment produced statistically significant protection of CA1 neurons (24% by oral and 20% by i.p. treatment). In a recent paper, Matucz et al. described GYKI-53405 (the racemate of talampanel) and EGIS-8332 (the 8-cyano, 8-methyl derivative of talampanel) to be neuroprotective in permanent focal ischemia produced by electrocoagulation of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and in transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats !!!REF!!!. In this study, one species was used and the effect of the extension of the therapeutic time window was not tested. Our present study was designed to determine whether talampanel has influence on the ischemic injury in two species and in different models of focal cerebral ischemia. To evaluate the potential clinical relevance various therapeutic time windows and occlusion times were also compared.  Excitatory amino acids such as glutamate (Glu) and aspartate are major neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of vertebrates, and their actions are mediated by both ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) !!!REFs!!!. While the former act as cation-gated ion channels, and are subdivided into -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and dl-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)/kinate receptors, the latter are G-protein-coupled receptors that operate by activating a variety of second messenger cascades. Previous studies have suggested that these receptors may contribute to the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis by potentiating vasopressin (AVP) secretion and water intake, in addition to participating in phenomena such as synaptic plasticity of neurons underlying memory and learning and the regulation of gonadal hormones. Namely Xu and Herbert have demonstrated that, when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) in rats, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 !!!REF!!! prevented the increases in plasma AVP and water intake caused by dehydration !!!REF!!! or angiotensin II (ANG II) !!!REF!!!, an endogenous substance probably responsible for the dehydration-induced events !!!REF!!!. These findings suggest involvements of periventricular NMDA receptors in those phenomena. However, details of the mechanisms regulated by these receptors and their locations in periventricular areas remain to be fully investigated. Within periventricular areas, there are lamina terminalis structures generally called the anteroventral third ventricular region (AV3V), consisting of the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis, the median preoptic nucleus, the periventricular nucleus and the medial preoptic area !!!REF!!!. The region lacks complete blood–brain and brain–cerebrospinal fluid barriers, shows osmosensitivity, contains receptors for various bioactive substances, including excitatory amino acids, ANG II and prostaglandin (PG) E2 !!!REFs!!!. Axon terminals of AV3V neurons extend to supraoptic and paraventricular AVP-secretory cells and to many sites controlling water intake and cardiovascular or other functions !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of plasma osmolality provoked by dehydration may facilitate AVP secretion by stimulating NMDA receptors in the AV3V. Observations !!!REF!!! that MK-801 infusion to AV3V was effective in blocking both NMDA and osmotically stimulated AVP secretion support validity of this view. However, in dehydrated circumstances, a reduction of extracellular fluid volume can also exert facilitatory influences on AVP secretion. Previous studies have suggested that AV3V neurons may play homeostatic roles not only in the hyperosmotic state, but also in the hypovolemic state. For example, the AV3V and nearby subfornical organ that sends axons to the AV3V are innervated by brainstem neurons related to cardiovascular functions !!!REFs!!!, and AV3V neurons projecting to the supraoptic or paraventricular nucleus are excited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem !!!REF!!!. Destruction of AV3V or local applications of drugs attenuated drinking, cardiovascular and AVP-releasing responses to hypovolemic or hypotensive stimuli !!!REFs!!! or chemical stimulation of AV3V Glu receptors !!!REFs!!!. In addition to these facts, cerebral ischemia associated with bleeding is known to be a potent stimulus in enhancing extracellular Glu through both promotion of release and prevention of uptake !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, it is possible that Glu mechanisms in AV3V may play a significant role in mediating homeostatic incidents elicited under hypovolemic conditions. In lines with this presumption, we recently reported that AVP secretion in response to PGE2 application to AV3V (PGE2 is one probable substance functioning under bleeding conditions !!!REF!!!) is inhibited by blockade of NMDA receptors or mGluRs !!!REFs!!!. To our knowledge, however, studies investigating the roles of AV3V Glu receptors in such states have not been reported yet, but a previous study employing tissue destruction technique has provided data suggesting that stimulation of AVP release by hypovolemia might occur independently of AV3V mechanisms !!!REF!!!. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the roles of Glu receptors in AV3V in mediating AVP release and other autonomic responses elicited by bleeding. Using conscious and unrestrained rats, we examined the effects of AV3V infusion of MK-801 or an mGluR antagonist, MCPG !!!REFs!!! on plasma AVP, ANG II, osmolality, glucose, electrolytes, heart rate and arterial pressure in the presence or absence of stimuli. Since drugs applied to AV3V could be assumed to induce effects by acting on remote areas through diffusion into the ventricular system, potencies of i.c.v. administrations of the antagonists were also analyzed for comparisons. Bleeding can result in plasma hyperosmolality by increasing plasma glucose !!!REFs!!!, an incident that maintains circulating blood volume. We recently detected that stimulation of AV3V NMDA receptors leads to hyperosmolality !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the question whether AV3V NMDA receptors may be implicated in blood glucose regulation in euvolemic and hypovolemic states was also explored.  Traumatic injury to the central and peripheral nervous system results in immunological challenge. Both neuronal and humoral activity evoked by neuronal damage leads to the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the spinal cord, which in turn leads to subsequent expression of immune factors !!!REF!!!. Damage to the nervous system also produces acute or chronic algesia or allodynia. Most pain research related to the neuroimmune function has focused on cytokines or growth factors, which have been strongly associated with pathological pain states both in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) !!!REFs!!!. Recently, several reports concerning the involvement of chemokines in inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia have been published !!!REFs!!!. Although chemokines are produced by resident and infilterating macrophages or by glia cells in the case of neuro-inflammatory pain, the involvement of chemokines in the pathogenesis of pain may result not only from the chemoattraction of immune cells but also from direct involvement in nociceptive signal transduction !!!REF!!!. Chemokines are a family of small chemoattractive cytokines. Chemokines are associated with the trafficking of leukocytes in physiological immune surveillances and the recruiting of inflammatory cells in the host defense. Chemokines are classified by their structure on the basis of the number and spacing of conserved cysteine motifs in the NH2 terminus !!!REFs!!!. Thus, four groups, the C, CC, CXC and CX3C families, have been distinguished. Besides their well-established role in the immune system, recent investigations have demonstrated that chemokines play a role in the CNS. In the CNS, chemokines are constitutively expressed by microglial cells, astrocytes and neurons. Expressions of chemokines and chemokine receptors have been observed in both the developing and adult brain !!!REFs!!!. Recently, the participation of central chemokines in pain modulation has been demonstrated. The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of the cytokine-induced neutropil chemoattractant (CINC)-1 on the mechanical nociceptive threshold in rats was examined using the paw pressure test !!!REF!!!. An intracerebroventricular injection of 1 or 10pg CINC-1 decreased the nociceptive threshold for mechanical stimuli. Immunohistochemical studies have also demonstrated the expression of the CXCR4 and CCR4 chemokine receptors and mRNAs of the receptors in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons that expressed substance P and vanilloid receptors !!!REF!!!. Although these results indicate that central chemokines participate in the modulation of pain processing in the CNS, there is no direct evidence regarding the involvement of central chemokines in the processing of inflammatory pain in the orofacial area. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of central chemokine-induced hyperalgesia, in the orofacial area, remain unclear. The present study investigated the effects of the intracisternal administration of chemokines on pain transmission in the orofacial area. Orofacial formalin-induced behavioral responses were examined after the intracisternal administration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation of normal T cells expressed and secreted (Rantes), members of the CC subgroup of the chemokine family, and interleukin-8 (IL-8), a member of the CXCR subgroup of the chemokine family. We also investigated the mechanisms of hyperalgesic responses produced by the intracisternal administration of IL-8.  There are many strong and long-lasting modifications that occur in the female rat during and following pregnancy, changes that are directed at successful reproduction. Among these is a long-lasting modification in the female's behavior toward young, a facilitation of maternal behavior. Mothers retain the memory for pups, and are maternal toward them, for many months following their initial exposure !!!REFs!!!. Such effects suggest a significant maternal memory for young that is resistant to the degradations of age and suggestive of significant alterations of the substrate for learning. The same hormones that stimulate maternal behavior may also affect such learning as presented above. In the hormonal profile characteristic of pregnancy, progesterone (P) and estradiol (E2) regulate the transition from non- to high-responsiveness to neonates !!!REF!!!. The temporal patterning of exposure to E2 and P during pregnancy, in particular, the progressive alteration of the ratio of the two hormones over the 3 weeks of gestation, are required for the eventual production of maternal behavior !!!REF!!!. Other substances, e.g., prolactin, placental lactogens, oxytocin, endogenous opioids, etc., also fluctuate temporally and are vital to pregnancy and parturition, as well as the onset of maternal behavior (see, e.g. !!!REFs!!!). The pregnancy hormones exert significant changes in behavior and physiological regulation in the female, with the immediate onset of maternal behavior – characteristic of the postpartum female – being the most striking. Several studies have reported that P and E modify the structure of the neuron in the adult female brain, for example, increasing the concentration of apical dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons !!!REFs!!!. These effects occur with relatively short exposure to the hormones, primarily E2, during the female's estrous cycle; if the level or pattern of E2 and P associated with the estrous cycle is prolonged or increased, as occurs during pregnancy, there may be even greater and/or long-lasting effects on the morphology and function of the neuron. A recent study using Golgi–Cox silver-staining revealed an example of neural plasticity due to pregnancy and its hormonal exposure !!!REF!!!. Neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a region that regulates maternal behavior !!!REF!!!, were examined in a group of females from different hormonal groups (ovariectomized [OVX], diestrus, sequential progesterone and estradiol exposed [P and E2, respectively], late-pregnant and lactating [day 5] rats). There was no difference between OVX and diestrous females, and both had significantly smaller somal areas compared to P- and E2-treated and late-pregnant females. Interestingly, the area of the soma returned to diestrus/OVX levels in lactating females, suggesting a return to baseline that follows the female's pregnancy hormonal state. Further, there were similar hormone-induced effects on number of dendritic branches and cumulative dendritic length in pregnant and hormone-treated groups compared to the OVX, diestrus and lactating females. The increase in perikarya area denotes increased cellular activity !!!REF!!!, whereas the stimulatory effect on additional neuronal variables represents modifications in information processing capacity. Pregnancy and its attendant hormonal exposure may stimulate neurons in the mPOA and, possibly other regions, which then contribute to the display of maternal behavior and its supporting activities. These effects may extend to other behaviors and additional brain regions. Reproductive experience and exposure to offspring significantly modify the brain and behavior of the female, particularly those required for effective care and rearing of offspring. For example, age-matched female rats with multiple reproductive experiences (RE; so-called multiparous females) exhibit reductions in opiate sensitivity relative to virgin/nulliparous or primiparous (zero or one parous experience, respectively) females !!!REF!!!. Further, parous females performed significantly better in tests of spatial ability, compared to age-matched nullparous (no RE) females !!!REF!!!. Together, the data suggest hormone–neuron interactions that have primarily maternal behavioral implications. The data above suggest strong effects of RE. The adult, developmental effects may be permanent and the ramifications may extend beyond maternal behavior, into the realm of aging and reproductive senescence. For instance, parous rats are known to exhibit normal estrous cyclicity and remain fertile longer than nulliparous rats !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, in the human, parity affects endocrine profiles and menstrual cycles for years following birth !!!REFs!!!. Other work has suggested that both hormones and enriching experiences are beneficial to the individual, mitigating aging-related decrements in learning, memory and brain health !!!REFs!!!. Thus, parity may well influence the reproductive aging of the female, in a sense “protecting” her system, by forestalling the species-specific climacteric and its ramifications. An additional benefit accruing to parity may be a lifelong influence on cognitive activities and other forms of learning. Recently, there have been suggestions that estrogen exposure may modify the severity of Alzheimer's disease !!!REFs!!!. We posit that natural hormone exposure, coupled to pup influences, may mean neuroprotection to the female for a lifetime. That is, the combinatorial experience of pregnancy, lactation and pup exposure appear to alter female brain and behavior. In fact, it has been argued that these plastic changes are the hallmark of the female brain as it prepares to care for an expensive metabolic and genetic investment !!!REFs!!!. The current work examines the persistence and strength of the effects of RE. Here, we examined the spatial learning and memory of nulliparous (NULL), primiparous (PRIM) and multiparous (MULT) rats across the lifespan. The data suggest that the effects of RE are long-lived and pervasive, affecting learning and memory, and hippocampal integrity, over the lifespan.  Epilepsy results from excessive discharges in a population of hyperexcitable neurons in cortex and some subcortical structures !!!REF!!!. This brain disorder was caused by multiple factors, including some specific gene expression alterations. The audiogenic seizure (AGS) is a generalized epilepsy model that has been often used to study the molecular mechanism of epilepsy and to develop novel therapeutic treatment for the brain disorder. AGS is characterized by a sequence of wild running, loss of righting reflex, clonus and tonus in response to high-intensity auditory stimulus. It has been shown that AGS requires activation of brainstem auditory pathways, in which it has been initiated largely through the midbrain inferior colliculus (IC), but may also involve additional subcortical and forebrain structures !!!REFs!!!. Although many genes have been identified to be associated with AGS, the neuronal signal pathway and molecular basis of the brain disorder remained to be elucidated. We combined chemical genetic and gene expression profiling approaches to investigate the molecular mechanism of AGS. Furthermore, we have proposed the mechanism of action of an anticonvulsant drug Qingyangshenylycosides (QYS) based on the gene expression profiling data. QYS is a mixture of several related compounds derived from the root of a traditional Chinese medicine, Cynanchum Otophyllum. Pharmacological characterization of the compounds indicated that the drug had a significant antiepileptic and anticonvulsant activity on kindling !!!REFs!!!, rat audiogenic seizures !!!REFs!!!, electroshock seizure and ferrous sulfate-induced epilepsy !!!REF!!!. However, the mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of QYS has not been clearly identified. Human diseases are often associated with gene expression changes. To understand the molecular mechanism of AGS, we analyzed the gene expression profiling in IC. In addition, we have taken chemical genetic approach to reveal the gene expression changes accompanied with the AGS prevention using the antiepileptic drug QYS. Furthermore, our studies helped to understand the mechanism of action of QYS.  It has been known for some time that frequently fragmented and disrupted sleep for prolonged periods can result in mood changes and impaired mental ability and performance !!!REFs!!!. Most of the human research has been focused on schedules of interrupting normal sleep that simulate insomnia, sleep apnea, other sleep disorders, and normal sleep wakefulness; in an attempt to correlate the different physiological changes characteristic of electroencephalographic defined sleep with increased sleepiness, decreased responsiveness, decreased attentiveness, lapses in short term memory, irritability, fatigue, all associated with and contributing to poor performance !!!REFs!!!. The differences between the symptoms of sleep disorders and chronic partial sleep deprivation have recently been described in an important review !!!REF!!!. Apparently total sleep deprivation as well as any sleep disruption (SD) schedule can induce sleepiness and impair performance. Sleep deprivation is usually defined as depriving a person or organism of sleep for various periods of fixed durations. SD might be defined as awakening a person at any time when they would normally be sleeping; sometimes SD occurs on a schedule but usually unexpectedly. SD occurs in a variety of different occupations: shift workers when changing shifts, military personnel in training exercises and under combat conditions, airline pilots, medical personnel; and children with interrupted sleep cycles. SD received national attention when it was reported that young children who frequently experience disrupted sleep were irritable and became aggressive when awakened !!!REF!!!. In some cases when SD occurred frequently performance in school was impaired. It appears as if any disruption of an entrained sleep pattern can induce learning and memory impairment; and mood changes including irritability and aggression. The focus of this report is on the physiological effects of SD associated with the impairment of learning and memory; one would expect impairment of learning and memory to depend upon changes in the excitability of relevant neural pathways in the brain and synaptic plasticity. The most commonly used method for measuring synaptic plasticity related to the learning and memory process is hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) !!!REF!!!. It seems reasonable to assume that the degree of LTP would vary during circadian rhythms and, in this case, sleep-wakefulness cycles; and possibly be affected by sleep deprivation and SD. An early report of changes in LTP during the light and dark cycle in rats showed clearly that more LTP occurred during the dark phase when rats are active and significantly less during the light phase. Also, adrenaletomized animals were the opposite of intact controls; during the light period more LTP occurred !!!REF!!!. Recently several important studies show decreased hippocampal LTP during various degrees of sleep deprivation in rats !!!REFs!!!. An early report in 2002 showed a decrease in normal LTP in CA1-Schaffer collateral synapses in vitro of approximately 30%; that was correlated with a significant increase in corticosterone levels; and indicated that not only stress but possibly other factors were contributing to the impairment of learning and memory associated with the forced activity; in a rotating drum, to deprive the rats from sleeping on a 1-day reversed light–dark cycle !!!REF!!!. When rats were REM sleep deprived for 24, 48, or 72h by means of the inverted flowerpot method results were similar !!!REF!!!. In the first study, the initial reduction in the sleep deprived animals was maintained for at least 60min; whereas, in the flowerpot study there was a gradual decline of approximately 10% following 24h sleep deprivation; and a more rapid reduction to baseline for both the 24 and 72h sleep deprived groups within 60min. The differences in these results might be attributable to the differences in the two methods and schedules for producing sleep deprivation. Results of a more comprehensive study of primarily rapid eye movement sleep deprivation for 72h based upon electroencephalographic recordings to establish the validity of the procedure; three methods for producing the sleep deprivation including a small platform, a large platform for the control animals, and six small platforms between which the animals could move !!!REF!!!. Neuronal membrane excitability as well as LTP was measured in CA1 and dentate granule cells; and long-term depression was measured in Schaffer collateral synapses. When contextual and cued memory were measured following 72h of sleep deprivation on the small platform, the ability to form new contextual memories was severely impaired; whereas the formation of cued memories was not affected. Whole cell patch clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells, following 72h of sleep deprivation, showed significantly reduced excitability in CA1 neurons and no change in the excitability of dentate granule cells. These sleep deprivation induced CA1 excitability changes did not appear to be associated with any of the changes in LTP due to sleep deprivation. Small platform REM sleep deprivation decreased LTP in both CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cells; and the impairment could not be attributable to immobilization induced stress since the control animals on the larger platform were subjected to only slightly lower levels of stress but displayed normal LTP. Animals on the less stressful multiple platform device also showed a significant impairment of LTP. Synaptic plasticity was fully recovered after 24h, as were any of the other cellular variables that were examined. Corticosterone levels were high in all groups. An earlier study reported similar effects !!!REF!!!; and sleep deprivation not only impaired LTP; but in both studies corticosterone levels increased by a factor of two. In humans !!!REF!!!, sleep deprivation and continuous arousal during sleep almost immediately increased cortisol and ACTH plasma concentration; however, these initial effects were temporary, average cortisol and ACTH concentrations for the entire night period did not change significantly and were not any higher than for normal sleep. The initial arousal cortisol burst was followed by a brief inhibition of cortisol secretion indicating that the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal system had become increasingly sensitive to negative feedback. For the most part, with the exception of stress related neuroendocrine changes during disrupted sleep !!!REF!!!, very little had been known about physiological changes in other brain regions that might explain cognitive impairments and mood changes until recently. Results of neuroimaging studies on sleep deprivation support what one might expect. Sleep deprivation induced sleepiness and impaired performance on a variety of cognitive tasks are associated with activity changes in brain systems involved in attention and arousal !!!REF!!!. Brain regions where activity changes occurred following 35h of sleep deprivation and produced sleepiness and changes in test performance were the left prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and left temporal lobe. Other brain regions responding differently to the mental tasks following sleep deprivation were the left primary and supplementary motor areas, left and right temporal lobes, left and right parietal lobes, and the cerebellum. More studies on sleep deprivation and functional neuroimaging are becoming available; however, there does not appear to be any imaging data on frequently fragmented or disrupted sleep. Functional MRI brain changes associated with a delayed-match-to-sample task before and following 48h of sleep deprivation tend to confirm some of the previous observations on brain region involvement !!!REF!!!. An activation pattern was identified that in general decreased with sleep deprivation; although the regions included in the activation pattern displayed covarying increases and decreases in activation. Activation decreases were observed in the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus all increased their activation. Similar patterns of changes in activation and decreases in activation, or deactivation, were observed during verbal working memory in two tasks differing in complexity following 24h of sleep deprivation !!!REF!!!. Response times were significantly larger for both tasks following sleep deprivation; however, performance was better on the more complex task. Brain region activation and deactivation and performance measures during the two tasks were compared following sleep deprivation to those obtained during rested wakefulness. After sleep deprivation, subjects experienced sleepiness and increased variability in response times. Both tasks induced smaller blood oxygen level signals in both parietal regions; and a large increase occurred in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These new findings show clearly that task performance is retained better for complex than simpler tasks following 24h sleep deprivation; and provide some of the neural correlates for the activation in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex that might be compensatory adaptations associated with the more complex tasks. The purpose of the present study was to measure the effects of SD on hippocampal LTP in anesthetized rats following three schedules of SD. SD was obtained by modifying the flowerpot procedure !!!REF!!! for producing sleep deprivation. Animals were placed on 1, 2, or 3 consecutive day schedules of SD. Following SD animals were anesthetized and LTP was measured in hippocampal perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses. LTP was measured in an additional three groups after 3, 6, or 9h on the 1-day SD schedule. SD not only severely impaired LTP but the animals became very excitable and aggressive. Male Harlan – rats weighing between 200 and 250g were utilized. All rats were allowed an acclimation period of 2 weeks before being used. Following a brief period of Isoflurane inhalation, animals were anesthetized using a dose of 1.4g/kg 25% urethane administered i.p. Surgical procedures were completed within 30min. Throughout the surgery and experiment, core body temperature was maintained at 35±1.0°C with a feedback control system and a heating pad. Experimental animals were sleep disrupted by placing them on a pedestal, an inverted truncated conical flowerpot, 12in. high with an exposed circular platform of 2.3in., surrounded by water to a height of 1in. from the top of the flowerpot. The small platform prevented animals from sleeping; because if they fell asleep, consequently they would fall into the water. Animals for each group remained on the pedestals 1, 2, or 3 SD day schedules from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and were returned to the vivarium at night from, 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. At 7:00 a.m. animals were anesthetized and prepared for surgery. SD control animals for each group were also placed on an inverted flowerpot surrounded by water, but the diameter of the platform was larger, 5.5inches. These animals were able to sleep, but were also subject to relative immobilization producing stress, due to limited motor activity !!!REF!!!. There were a total of 10 groups, five animals in each group. There was one normal LTP control group; three experimental SD groups, plus their corresponding SD control groups; and three experimental time dependency SD groups. Animals from each of the six experimental groups, as well as the controls, were anesthetized the following morning at 7:00 a.m. Approximately 2h were required to obtain the required level of anesthesia, complete the surgery, and to obtain the baseline before the first tetanus was applied. LTP in these animals was obtained approximately 14h after each of the three SD schedules was completed. In the three experimental time dependency SD groups, animals were sleep disrupted for 3, 6, or 9h. Therefore in these animals LTP was measured 2h after the completion of the three SD periods at 5, 8, or 11h, respectively. Glass micropipette recording electrodes were prepared and filled with 3M NaCl. Resistance ranged from 1 to 3MΩ. Recording electrodes were positioned approximately 3.5mm posterior to bregma and 2.0mm lateral to the midline according to the Paxinos and Watson Atlas !!!REF!!!. The dentate gyrus was identified by single unit activity characteristic of granule cells as well as by an electrode depth of 3.0–3.5mm below the brain surface. The position of the recording electrode was adjusted to produce an optimal population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) in the granule cell molecular layer. Average stimulating electrode coordinates were 8.0mm posterior and 4.2mm lateral to bregma and 2.0mm beneath the cortical surface. The stimulating electrodes were stainless steel concentric bipolar electrodes purchased from FHC Co. The stereotaxic coordinates were adjusted for variation in rat ages and to maximize the monosynaptic responses of the positive-going pEPSP produced by the granule cells in response to stimulation of the dorsomedial perforant path afferents. The average stimulating coordinates were 8.5mm posterior to bregma and 4.4mm lateral to the midline. At the end of the experiment, placement in the dorsomedial perforant path was verified with a 100Hz tetanic stimulation. Stimulation consisted of 50μs duration monophasic constant current pulses delivered once per min. In these experiments, stimulation ranged from 100 to 200μA. The slope of an individual pEPSP was measured during the first millisecond in the linear range of the rising phase. Generation of an / plot was used to determine the half max pEPSP amplitude, as well as the stimulus intensity for that value. Once determined, the stimulus current remained constant throughout the experiment. After a 30min baseline recording of pEPSPs, four sets of tetanic trains, separated by 10min intervals at 30, 40, 50 and 60min, were administered to induce LTP. Each set contained five trains, 10 pulses per train, 400Hz, delivered at a rate of 1 train/s for 5s. The pulse widths in the trains were 50, 100, 150, and 200μs, respectively. The pEPSPs were recorded every minute for 130min. The granule cell pEPSPs were amplified by a conventional amplifier at a frequency band of 1.6Hz–2kHz. All potentials were monitored on an oscilloscope and digitized at a sampling interval of 20μs for on-line computer display. LTP was calculated as the percent increase in the mean baseline slopes of the pEPSPs for each animal following the first tetanus at 1min intervals until the end of the experiment. The experimental design was the same for each experiment and means for the last 10min of LTP for each group were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA. When appropriate, significance of specific comparisons between groups were determined by means of the Student–Newman–Keuls test, <0.05. Statistical analyses were carried out by means of Sigma Stat.  The mammalian brain contains a pool of histochemically reactive, ionic zinc (Zn2+). In the neocortex and hippocampus, synaptic zinc is sequestered within synaptic vesicles of a subset of glutamatergic terminals and is released together with glutamate upon depolarization (for review, see !!!REF!!!). It is considered to be an atypical neuromodulator, which regulates neurotransmission and exerts a variety of neuromodulatory actions, mainly influencing ionotropic receptors by inhibiting NMDA and GABAA receptors and potentiating AMPA and glycine receptors !!!REF!!!. Synaptic zinc can contribute to activity-dependent forms of plasticity, such as LTP, as well as learning and memory processes !!!REFs!!!. In the neocortex, the distribution pattern of synaptic zinc shows distinct interlaminar differences with the lowest zinc staining intensity in layer 4 !!!REF!!!. Zinc-containing terminals present in this layer derive from intracortical zinc-ergic neurons located outside layer 4 !!!REFs!!!. The level of synaptic zinc is strictly developmentally regulated !!!REFs!!!. In the barrel cortex of mice and rats, a cortical representation of mystacial vibrissae !!!REF!!!, an area known to undergo experience-dependent plasticity in both development and adulthood, synaptic zinc cannot be detected until postnatal day 6 (P6). At later ages, the level of synaptic zinc increases and in layer 4 a barrel-like pattern of zinc staining can be easily discerned due to strong staining of interbarrel septa in comparison to faint staining of barrel !!!REFs!!!. The time-course of developmental changes in synaptic zinc seems to be coincident with synaptogenesis in the neocortex, and therefore, staining for zinc has been proposed to be a good marker for synaptogenesis !!!REF!!!. Cortical synaptic zinc may undergo dynamic changes upon alterations of neuronal activity !!!REFs!!!. Sensory deprivation by trimming or plucking selected vibrissae results in an increase in the synaptic zinc staining in the corresponding deprived barrels as compared to neighboring non-deprived ones and to barrels in non-deprived hemisphere. The magnitude and persistence of this effect depends on the age of the mice and duration of sensory deprivation. In adult mice, short-term (several hours) sensory deprivation resulted in a rapid but transient increase of synaptic zinc staining in corresponding barrels in the cortex !!!REFs!!!. However, when deprivation is started during early postnatal days and maintained for 3 weeks, a persistent increase in synaptic zinc staining in deprived barrels is observed !!!REFs!!!. These studies suggest an experience-dependent permanent remodeling of zinc-containing circuits. One possible reason for this activity-dependent elevation of synaptic zinc level is an increase of zinc transporter expression, either in preexisting nerve terminals or due to axonal sprouting of zinc-ergic terminals. Among the many zinc transporters identified !!!REF!!!, the involvement of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) seems to be the most probable, since ZnT3 appears essential for the accumulation of zinc within synaptic vesicles !!!REF!!!. Indeed, in the adult mouse hippocampus, there is a correspondence between ZnT3 expression and synaptic zinc staining !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, ZnT3-knockout mice are lacking histochemically reactive zinc in synaptic vesicles !!!REF!!!. Our aim in the present work was to examine whether the developmental expression of ZnT3 in the barrel cortex of mice corresponded to a postnatal developmental time-course of synaptic zinc. Secondly, we wanted to determine whether the expression pattern of ZnT3 follows the pattern of synaptogenesis as compared with the expression of synapsin I and synaptophysin—proteins considered to be synaptic markers. Additionally, we wanted to investigate whether sensory deprivation affects ZnT3, synapsin I and synaptophysin expression in the barrel cortex. For this purpose we used two different experimental paradigms, which, as we reported previously, produced an increase in synaptic zinc staining in deprived barrels: (1) short-term; (1 day) unilateral sensory deprivation by trimming selected vibrissae in adult mice; (2) long-term sensory deprivation by daily trimming selected vibrissae unilaterally for 3 weeks starting from P3 !!!REFs!!!.  ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels with different pharmacological properties are present on the plasmalemmal membrane and on the inner mitochondrial membrane !!!REFs!!!. Considerable interest has been generated recently from studies in which activation of mitochondrial (mito)KATP channels has been shown to be protective against anoxic and chemical stresses in brain. In the first publication on this topic, we showed that application of diazoxide, the prototypic opener of mitoKATP channels, provided immediate protection of neurons against ischemic stress in neonatal pigs !!!REF!!!. Protective effects of diazoxide were reversed by co-administration of 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) which has been suggested to be a selective antagonist of mitoKATP channels or at least a selective antagonist of the actions of diazoxide !!!REFs!!!. Additional studies in cultured brain cells !!!REFs!!! in the neonatal pig !!!REF!!! or in the rat brain !!!REFs!!! in vivo have further established the protective effects of diazoxide. Protective effects of diazoxide apparently involve both mitoKATP channel opening and production/actions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) !!!REFs!!!. Whether the production of ROS by diazoxide is secondary to mitoKATP opening or is due to an inhibitory action of diazoxide on succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is unknown !!!REF!!!. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the effects of diazoxide on mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ m) and ROS production were due to the activation of mitoKATP channels or other effects, such as SDH inhibition. In isolated piglet mitochondria, we compared effects of diazoxide with a newly developed mitoKATP channel opener, BMS-191095, which does not increase ROS production in cultured neurons !!!REF!!! and apparently does not inhibit SDH. Additionally, we administered 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), a specific inhibitor of SDH !!!REF!!!, which appears to have no direct effect on mitoKATP channels.  Completion of genome sequences marks an exciting new era for the study of gene function in biological processes. Understanding how the genome functions as a whole in the complex behavioral situation presents a great challenge. Knowing when and where genes are expressed and regulated can provide crucial clues as to the molecular and cellular mechanisms of a given behavior. On the other hand, the patterns of genes expressed in the brain can provide valuable information about the cognitive state. Recent progress in gene chip or DNA microarray technology makes it possible to monitor large-scale gene expression induced by behavioral learning paradigm. This approach has offered a view of molecular and genetic responses underlying many behavioral and cognitive changes including brain aging, effects of environment enrichment on brain function, and development of the hippocampus !!!REF!!!. Emotional memories tend to be long lasting and play an important role in regulating the behavioral responses of animals. Most of the current knowledge of emotional memories comes from the study of classical fear conditioning. It is believed that contextual fear conditioning is dependent on the structural integrity of the hippocampus and amygdala, whereas cued fear conditioning is hippocampal-independent, but requires the amygdala !!!REFs!!!. Pharmacological and genetic experiments further suggest the formation of many associative memories including contextual and cued fear memory requires activation of the NMDA receptor !!!REFs!!!. In this study, we report the application of gene chip technique for the analysis of the large-scale transcriptional responses that occur in the amygdala and hippocampus after fear conditioning.  neurons, a subset of (CT) neurons well-defined in the golden hamster (), are quite specific for stimuli that are sweet and respond with a characteristic rhythmic bursting pattern !!!REFs!!!. The CT innervates taste buds within fungiform papillae in the epithelium of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Taste-nerve and behavioral responses of transgenic mice, and the distribution of candidate and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) among taste receptor cells (TRCs) are consistent with for the sweet and bitter tastes. A labeled line transmits information about one taste quality from TRCs to brain !!!REFs!!!. and GPCR determine chemical selectivity and are expressed in separate TRC subsets that initiate, respectively, behavioral aversion or preference !!!REFs!!!. However, transmission of information about sweet stimuli to the brain by neurons !!!REF!!! occurs after initial processing among TRCs in taste buds !!!REFs!!!. Studies of taste-nerve responses to stimulus mixtures suggest possible functions of the taste-bud processing. Candidate peripheral labeled-line codes are based on studies using single-compound, uni-quality stimuli. However, the gustatory system most often deals with heterogeneous mixtures composed of stimuli with different taste qualities. In mixtures, quinine hydrochloride, a prototype bitter stimulus, inhibits CT afferent signals elicited by a prototype sweet stimulus: sucrose. Primary evidence for this interaction comes from the hamster CT, which shows response suppression exclusively in neurons. In the CT there is no reciprocal suppression of quinine responses by sucrose !!!REFs!!!, a reciprocity observed in third order taste neurons of the parabrachial nucleus !!!REFs!!!. How across-quality inhibition relates to proposed peripheral labeled-line codes has not been addressed. Hamsters behaviorally prefer and cross-generalize with sucrose many, but by no means all, stimuli that are sweet to humans !!!REFs!!!. Such stimuli include the synthetic sweetener, dulcin (-ethoxyphenyl urea), and the amino acid, d-phenylalanine !!!REFs!!!. Hamsters do not behaviorally cross-generalize the sweeteners with quinine. Besides inhibiting sucrose responses in CT neurons, quinine, along with other ionic stimuli that hamsters cross-generalize with quinine, activates electrolyte-sensitive neurons !!!REFs!!!. neurons are generalists that are also activated by stimuli !!!REF!!!, and, thus, are unlikely lines. To determine whether quinine inhibition is specific for disaccharides like sucrose or may be as broad as the stimulus set activating neurons, quinine–dulcin mixtures were studied. Dulcin, an aryl urea, is structurally similar to the sweet amino acid d-phenylalanine. Importantly, like sucrose, dulcin specifically activates CT neurons !!!REFs!!!; and both sucrose and dulcin are ligands for the rat candidate T1 sweet receptor, heterodimeric GPCR, T1R2/T1R3 !!!REF!!!. Analysis of CT whole-nerve and single-unit data on quinine–dulcin and quinine–sucrose mixtures is straightforward because quinine and sweeteners activate distinct subsets CT neurons.  The development of the visual system, as well as many other brain areas, follows a use-dependent rule in which the coincident activity of afferents favors their synaptic stabilization within postsynaptic territories !!!REFs!!!. This phenomenon takes place both during normal development of neural circuits as during use-dependent modifications due to lesion or environmental-induced changes in axonal connectivity !!!REFs!!!. The mammalian retinotectal pathways have been extensively studied revealing a great plastic capacity of retinal projections in neonates and determining a limiting critical period within the first two post natal weeks. This critical period comprises both the normal development !!!REFs!!! and the lesion-induced plasticity of the uncrossed pathways, following retinal lesion/eye enucleation experiments !!!REFs!!!. In the geniculo-cortical pathway, ocular dominance column formation also takes place in a very restricted time window, as use-dependent plasticity subsequently wanes !!!REFs!!!. Thus, these studies point out that after the end of the critical period, no significant plasticity should be expected, either in retinotectal or in thalamocortical visual pathways. On the other hand, noticeable plasticity of intra-cortical connections have been described in adulthood including the plasticity of cortical visual, somatosensory and motor maps !!!REFs!!!. The question remains, however, as to how restricted brain plasticity actually is, particularly in the subcortical primary pathways. Does the maturation of retinotectal projections determine the end of the plastic period? Is plasticity completely halted after the end of the critical period? Retinal lesions have been used as a model for visual system plasticity. Earlier studies have shown that restricted lesions to the temporal periphery of the retina of rat pups induced a rapid reorganization of the uncrossed retinotectal pathway of the intact eye !!!REF!!!, which was modulated by serotonin !!!REF!!! and by nitric oxide !!!REF!!!. In the present work, we have studied the time course and the extent of rearrangements in the intact uncrossed retinotectal projection, after a monocular retinal lesion in the opposite eye at various post natal ages, using short and long-term survival times.  Oxygen and nitrogen free radicals are thought to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hypoxic ischemic brain injury (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Free radical production has been detected in animal brains during cerebral ischemia and the levels of free radicals increase significantly at the onset of reperfusion !!!REFs!!!. Agents known to scavenge or enzymatically degrade free radicals have been shown to be neuroprotective in hypoxic ischemic brain injury !!!REF!!!. Grape seed extracts contain a number of polyphenols including procyanidins and proanthocyanidins and are powerful free radical scavengers. Grape seed extracts are marketed in the United States as a dietary supplement and are reasonably safe and readily available !!!REFs!!!. Grape seed extract have been reported to possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological, and therapeutic effects including anti-inflammatory activity and reduced apoptotic cell death !!!REFs!!!. Grape seed extracts protect heart function and reduce infarct size in experimental cardiac ischemia !!!REFs!!!. Grape seed extracts prevent apoptotic and non-apoptotic liver cell death in acetaminophen induced liver damage !!!REF!!! and reduce proteinuria in puromycin induced nephrosis !!!REF!!!. Both acetaminophen induced liver damage and puromycin induced nephrosis are thought to be caused by free radicals. Recently, Hwang et al. !!!REF!!! reported that grape seed extracts reduced neuronal damage in the adult gerbil after 5min of forebrain ischemia. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is a serious cause of death and disability in human newborns. The developmental stage of the brain of the 7-day-old rat pup resembles that of newborn humans !!!REF!!!. The Rice–Vannucci–Brierley hypoxic ischemic rat pup model !!!REF!!! may best match the injury caused by birth asphyxia in full-term human infants (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Therefore, study of the role of neuroprotective agents in the neonatal hypoxic ischemic rat model may provide important information pertinent to the development of treatment for perinatal hypoxic ischemic brain damage. The neonatal rat hypoxic ischemic model !!!REF!!! has been well characterized and extensively used to assess synthetic neuroprotective agents !!!REFs!!!. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether treatment with grape seed extract would reduce brain injury in newborn rats and to determine whether grape seed extract could attenuate the formation of oxygen free radicals, as measured by 8-isoprostaglandin F2α and thiobarbituric acid reacting substances in the hypoxic ischemic rat pup model. This has not previously been tested.  The traditional view holds that posterior alpha oscillations are responsive to visual stimulation !!!REF!!! and attentional demands !!!REF!!!. Studies distinguishing between different sub-bands, however, showed that upper alpha oscillations (in a frequency range of about 10–12Hz) are particularly responsive to semantic processing demands !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, the extent of alpha desynchronization as measured by the event-related desynchronization (ERD) method !!!REF!!! appears to be related to memory performance !!!REF!!! and intelligence !!!REFs!!!. Although a variety of different studies reported a significant relationship between upper alpha ERD and memory performance or intelligence !!!REFs!!!, the direction of this relationship is a matter of debate. Whereas, some studies found that a large extent of ERD is indicative of good performance !!!REFs!!! others have obtained the opposite result !!!REFs!!!. In some studies the direction of this effect depended on specific factors such as gender !!!REFs!!!. The negative relationship between ERD and performance was interpreted in terms of the neural efficiency hypothesis !!!REFs!!! suggesting that good performance is associated with a more ‘efficient’ and, thus, smaller extent of cortical activation that is related to a smaller extent of upper alpha ERD. It is generally assumed that alpha ERD – as a measure of the event-related decrease in alpha band power – reflects cortical activation !!!REFs!!!. This assumption is based on the fact that during an inactive state (e.g., during rest or a reference period) alpha power is large but becomes suppressed in response to the presentation and processing of a stimulus and/or increased cognitive task demands. We assume that one reason for these divergent results may be related to the type of task. Findings from Klimesch et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrate that upper alpha ERD is reliably responsive to verbal-semantic processing. Thus, we argue that a positive relationship between ERD and intelligence can be expected only if ERD is measured task specific, i.e. under demands that actually require the processing of semantic information. If, on the other hand, no semantic processing is required this positive correlation might vanish. As an example, in agreement with the neural efficiency hypothesis, Jausovec and Jausovec !!!REF!!! found in an acoustic oddball task that more intelligent subjects exhibit less upper alpha ERD. Semantic memory comprises general, non-modality specific knowledge about the world, and thus an oddball task typically does not require the access and retrieval of stored semantic information, but instead the updating of new information !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, acoustic stimulation has no or little effect on alpha desynchronization (measured from the scalp), because the auditory cortex lies deep in the brain and the tau rhythm can only be detected with other methods, e.g., with the MEG !!!REF!!!. Thus, the findings by Jausovec and Jausovec !!!REF!!! probably indicate that more intelligent subjects show less ERD because they are more efficient in blocking information processing in non-task relevant brain areas. In contrast to the neural efficiency hypothesis we call this interpretation the ‘inhibition hypothesis’. Most interestingly, in none of the other studies that support the neural efficiency hypothesis, tasks were used that specifically require verbal-semantic processing. As an example, in a sentence verification task, Neubauer et al. !!!REF!!! asked their subjects first to read a sentence such as “star is left of plus” and then to decide whether the visual presentation of “ + * ” matches the respective sentence (in this case not, because the star is right, instead of left of the plus). Sentences of this type will require semantic processing to a minor degree only. As descriptions of artificial spatial relations between symbols they have no obvious relationship to information stored in semantic long-term memory. Thus, the finding of a smaller ERD (at posterior sites) for more intelligent subjects obtained by Neubauer et al. !!!REF!!! may also be interpreted on the basis of the suggested ‘inhibition’ hypothesis. More intelligent subjects may be more efficient in inhibiting brain areas (or distributed processing systems) that are not (or not directly) task relevant. Because the semantic processing system is not (directly) relevant for performing the sentence verification task, more intelligent subjects are more efficient in suppressing this system and thus will exhibit less ERD. In agreement with this interpretation, the data reported by Neubauer et al. !!!REF!!! actually show that during task performance, more intelligent subjects already exhibit pronounced ERS at frontal sites. Several studies suggested !!!REFs!!! and documented !!!REF!!! that alpha ERS reflects a state of inhibition. Accordingly, the data by Neubauer et al. !!!REF!!! may indicate that good performers are actually able to inhibit semantic processing at frontal areas, which are related to the encoding, retrieval and manipulation but not the storage of semantic information !!!REF!!!. Similar arguments apply to the letter matching task !!!REFs!!!, the triplet number task !!!REF!!!, and the digit span task !!!REF!!!. Thus, findings supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis are based on tasks that do not require the access and processing of stored semantic information. In the present study, we used a task that clearly required the processing of information stored in semantic long-term memory. From two different intelligence tests, the Intelligenz Struktur test 2000 !!!REF!!! (IST 2000) and the WILDE Intelligenz-test !!!REF!!! (WIT) a set of semantic analogy tasks were compiled. Our hypothesis is that because of its semantic nature a clear positive relationship between upper alpha ERD and intelligence should be observed in this task.  Some of the earliest lesion studies had identified the rostral hypothalamus as the important brain area in the regulation of body temperature !!!REFs!!!. Most of the subsequent studies had investigated the role of the preoptic area and the anterior hypothalamus as the critical regions for thermoregulation !!!REFs!!!. But, apart from these areas, thermosensitive neurons were shown to be present in the adjoining septum also in rats !!!REFs!!!. Stimulation of the medial septum (MS) in rats produced an increase in hypothalamic temperature !!!REF!!!. After electrolytic lesions of the posterior septal regions in cats there were hypothermia and an inability to thermoregulate during heat stress !!!REF!!!. According to another report, electrolytic lesions of the septal regions in cats had no effect on the intensity of shivering caused by lowering of the environmental temperature !!!REF!!!. Though single neuronal recording studies and stimulation studies indicate that the MS in rats is involved in thermoregulation, there are no studies, where the neurons of the MS were destroyed to find out the role of this region in thermoregulation. Moreover, the results from electrolytic lesion studies on different species of animals are contradictory. In none of these reports, brain temperature ( br), which is the most critical temperature for thermoregulation, had been studied.  Several studies have demonstrated that embryonic nigral grafts reinnervate the striatum and mediate clinically relevant recovery in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients !!!REFs!!!. However, one of the major limitations of neural transplantation as a therapy for PD patients is the poor survival (typically 5–10%) of transplanted dopaminergic neurons, and the restricted reinnervation of the host striatum from the graft !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, around 30% of the cells die already during the preparation of the donor tissue prior to grafting !!!REFs!!!, and approximately 90% of the dopaminergic neurons are dead by the end of the first week after grafting !!!REFs!!!. Consequently, tissue from several embryos has to be implanted into each patient !!!REF!!!. Several strategies to improve the survival of transplanted dopaminergic neurons by treating the donor tissue prior to implantation have been evaluated in animal experiments !!!REF!!!. Some of the experimental findings, such as the survival-enhancing effect of the lipid-peroxidation inhibitor Tirilazad Mesylate have already been tested clinically !!!REF!!!. Administration of neurotrophic factors to the host brain, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or Neurturin for several days after implantation can improve the survival of transplanted dopaminergic neurons and enhance fiber outgrowth from grafted cells in animal models of PD !!!REF!!!. However, one practical limitation is that neurotrophic factors have to be administered repeatedly or continuously to the host striatum. The technique to use polymer-encapsulated cell lines modified to produce neurotrophic factors continuously might be a way to circumvent this problem. This technique has been tested successfully in hemiparkinsonian rats transplanted with rat embryonic dopaminergic neurons !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, the technique has already been used clinically to deliver ciliary neurotrophic factor to the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis !!!REFs!!!, patients with Huntington's disease as well as motor neuron disease !!!REF!!!. In the current study we investigated whether GDNF has an effect on graft survival, fiber outgrowth and function of xenotransplanted human dopaminergic neurons when administered via polymer-encapsulated GDNF-producing cells.  In the context of the reaction time (RT) paradigm, an efficient way to study motor preparation processes is to inform the subject about the upcoming stimulus and/or response. This is generally done by providing advanced information about either the characteristics of the forthcoming movement and/or the occurrence of the stimulus. Subjects can use the event information to prepare for specific events and the temporal information to be ready at the right time. The changes in RT related to event and time information, respectively, allow the investigators to draw inferences about the corresponding preparatory processes. RT values are used as an index of complexity of the motor programmation. The longer the RT, the more difficult is the motor task to program !!!REF!!!. RT is frequently fractioned into (a) a premotor time, that is, the delay between the onset of an imperative signal and the first discernible change in the focal EMG activity, and (b) a motor time, that is, the delay between the first focal EMG activity (i.e., allowing the execution of the movement oriented toward a goal) and the initiation of the movement !!!REFs!!!. The premotor time seems to represent a more appropriate measure to characterize the neural processes involved in the initiation of the movement !!!REFs!!!. Generally, the experimenters manipulate different factors affecting RT. One of them is the foreperiod duration (FD) which is the time elapsed between a preparatory signal and the imperative stimulus. For instance, when the FD varies across blocks of trials, subjects time their preparation in order to be optimally ready at the onset of the imperative signal. However, RT increases with longer FDs !!!REF!!! because the estimation of the time remaining before the onset of the imperative signal becomes less precise !!!REF!!!. In addition, it has been shown that RT values take the form of a U-shaped curve with an increase of the FD !!!REFs!!!. RT is the shortest with a 500ms FD !!!REFs!!!. This FD has been called the optimal FD. However, this result has been found in press-button tasks for subjects seated in a comfortable chair with back. That is, when the regulation of postural sway was easier than in standing because of a larger base of support and a lower position of the centre of gravity increasing stability. For example, Vuillerme and Nougier !!!REF!!! showed that RT in a seated posture with back is shorter than in a bipedal or unipodal posture (standing). Simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time (CRT) tasks were used to compare the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) in standing according to the length of the premotor time, especially during fast voluntary arm movements !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, during postural perturbations induced by fast arm movements in a standing condition, changes in the activity of the arm muscles initiating the focal movement are typically preceded by earlier changes in the background activity of the postural muscles (i.e., which ensure to maintain of the projection of the centre of gravity into the base of support). The assumed role of APAs is to counteract the expected mechanical effects of the focal perturbation in a feedforward way suggesting that they are generated at a high level of the central nervous system (CNS) !!!REFs!!!. In many works studying the APAs of a focal movement made by standing subjects in a self-paced (SP), SRT or CRT task, the relative timing of the postural and focal components of the movement was different in SP movements as compared to those performed in a SRT task !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, premotor time in a SRT task is known to be shorter than in a CRT task. More specifically, in the SRT task, APAs occurred later and frequently simultaneously with the first discernible changes in the EMG activity of the focal muscle !!!REFs!!!. Few authors have studied APAs during CRT tasks !!!REFs!!!. They showed that the longer the planning time allowed prior to the focal movement (i.e., premotor time), the earlier was the onset of the APAs. Thus, it appears that the duration of the premotor time is sensitive to the feedforward command. However, reports regarding APAs while sitting were somewhat conflicting. In reaching tasks, APAs were absent !!!REF!!!. When seated subjects exerted a maximal force on a bar, APAs were present in the trunk and hip muscles !!!REFs!!!. However, Aruin and Shiratori !!!REF!!! calculated the latencies of APAs using the comparison between the EMG onset of postural muscles and the onset of an external force (pushing or pulling a can) defined as time zero. In addition, in this study, movements were performed without feet support and in a sitting posture without back, which is known to modify the APAs. Two different schemes of the central control of APAs have been considered: the single-process scheme (also called the hierarchical process control scheme) and the dual-process scheme also called the parallel process control scheme. According to the single-process scheme, the hypothetical controller makes no distinction between the focal and postural components of the motor task. Within this scheme, one could expect the onset of the focal movement to be time-locked to the postural response !!!REF!!!. However, it is unclear how the central commands for the focal movement and postural adjustments are linked together. The dual-process scheme assumes the existence of two independent control processes organizing the focal and postural components of an action. Each postural adjustment arises from a different detailed and specific organization of the motor commands at the level of the neural structures controlling motor planning, i.e., the high hierarchical level of the CNS !!!REFs!!!. Investigations on the effects of preparation on posture are scarce. Studies based on a mental chronometry procedure (RT task) showed that the optimal motor preparation (leading to the shortest RT) in a seated position without generating APAs (a press-button task) resulted from a foreperiod about 500ms duration. The purpose of the present experiment was to further investigate the motor and postural preparation processes while standing. More specifically, it aimed at: (1) identifying, in standing, a FD for which preparation was optimal, and confirming that this FD was longer than in sitting because the postural component of the movement takes more time to program !!!REF!!!, and (2) investigating presumable modulations in the central organization of the postural and focal commands induced by the FD.  In rodent models of undernutrition, prenatal and perinatal protein deprivation results in a variety of adverse behavioral, neurochemical and morphological effects !!!REFs!!!. However, the consequences of protein deprivation on brain metabolism and behavior of adult animals have not been extensively examined. In one of the few studies in this area, rats consuming an 8% protein diet for 8 months displayed morphologic and behavioral deficits, including a loss of neurons in the hippocampus, reduced responsiveness to a novel environment and abnormalities in spatial learning !!!REF!!!. That study indicated that chronic consumption of a diet deficient in total protein has adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS), but the effects of short-term consumption of a low-protein diet remain undocumented. To function adequately, the CNS requires amino acids found in protein foods, including tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, glutamine and arginine, as substrates for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators !!!REFs!!!. To date, CNS requirements for protein or specific amino acids have not been systematically investigated because it was assumed that brain requirements for precursor amino acids were not relevant for determining an animal's requirements for dietary protein !!!REF!!!. However, it has been suggested recently that there may be functional requirements for specific amino acids in the brain and periphery that may be important factors for determination of protein and amino acid requirements !!!REFs!!!. Several lines of research suggest that the availability of particular amino acids can be a factor in the regulation of central neurotransmission, cognitive performance and mood (for reviews see !!!REFs!!!). Furthermore, even brief changes in the availability of several of these amino acid precursors can change brain neurotransmission and behavior. For example, if a single meal deficient in the amino acid tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), is administered to humans, transient depression-like symptoms are observed !!!REF!!!. Knowing central nervous system requirements for specific amino acids during periods of undernutrition or when individuals are exposed to highly stressful conditions may be critical. For example, among modestly undernourished, but not highly stressed soldiers participating in a field test of a calorie-deficient ration, decrements in plasma tryptophan were associated with impaired cognitive performance !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, animal and human studies suggest that tyrosine administration increases brain catecholaminergic neurotransmission and has beneficial effects on behavioral parameters associated with stress resistance !!!REFs!!!. Tyrosine is one of the dietary precursors for brain synthesis of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine. Wurtman et al. !!!REF!!! proposed that the neurochemical and behavioral consequences of supplemental tyrosine administration would most readily be observed when humans and other animals are exposed to various environmental and psychological stressors. Subsequent research has confirmed this hypothesis !!!REFs!!!. We examined changes in several stress-related behaviors and brain release of neurotransmitters produced by a relatively brief (11 days) exposure to a low (4%)-protein diet in animals exposed to normothermic and stressful (hyperthermic) environmental conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine if relatively brief periods of low protein intake affect selected stress-related behaviors and brain neurotransmitters.  Place learning in a water maze (WM) is a widely used cognitive test in rodents !!!REF!!! and can be modified to discriminate between different strategies employed to solve the problem. Rats can learn to find the platform in a circular tank using different strategies such as using visual cues, navigational cues, response learning, thigmotaxis, etc. The WM task can be designed to force the animal to use only one strategy. For example, if the platform is visible, then the animal can use direct visual cues, but if it is hidden below the water, then the “visual cue” strategy will become ineffective and the animal will need to find another approach, such as using using spatial cues (i.e., extramaze cues) to navigate. The WM problem can be designed to allow for the use of a single strategy and performance of the rats can be assumed to reflect ability. In this case, preventive measures should be taken to differentiate between cognitive vs. motor capacity of the subjects and to rule out motivational differences. The place learning task can also be designed to present more than one option (i.e., a choice) for the animal to solve the problem, thereby allowing the experimenter to test if there is a cognitive strategy preference. Cognitive strategy is influenced by various factors including sex of the subject, pharmacological manipulations, age or hormones !!!REF!!!. We have used this approach to study sex differences in cognitive strategy in rats and to analyze various factors, which may impact this difference !!!REFs!!!. The rat's ability to find the platform [escape latency (EL)] was assessed for 12 days, with the platform, always in the same place, but visible on days 1–3, 5–7, and 9–11, and hidden on the remaining days. The visible condition requires a “look-out” strategy for learning, whereas the hidden condition requires a spatial, “navigational” cognitive style. In these studies, different groups of rats acquired both the visible and hidden tasks similarly confirming that there were no cognitive ability differences between the groups. After acquisition, on Day 13, the rats were challenged by a new cognitive task (platform position shifted and the platform made visible). Although only the platform in the new place provided escape, initially the rats did not have that information and therefore the first trial of the shift task can be assumed to present a choice for the rats. If rats swam directly to the newly positioned visible platform, which was also closer, this was interpreted as preference for using direct visual cues; if they continued to search for the platform where it used to be during acquisition, this was interpreted to reflect preference for spatial, navigational cognitive style. Females had a very distinct preference for using visual cues in place learning which appeared only after puberty (the final critical period of brain development when the surge of gonadal hormones have substantial organizational effects) !!!REF!!! and was not affected substantially by gonadal hormonal manipulations as adults !!!REF!!!, was eliminated by nicotine !!!REF!!!, correlated with cortical nitric oxide (NO) levels !!!REF!!! and was sensitive to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition !!!REF!!!. There are various factors that may additionally influence the rat's choice such as looking around to see the newly positioned visible platform, calculating the distance to the platforms, and motivation to try “novelty”. Rats can also find place by using their bodies as a reference; for example, they can find a platform by always turning to their right or left (i.e., response learning). In the present study, we have modified the WM place learning task to force the rats to locate the platform using response learning. Differences in cerebral lateralization patterns play an important role in sex differences in humans !!!REFs!!! and in rodents !!!REFs!!!. Sex differences depicted in rodents involve spatial learning (favoring males) and the hippocampal formation; male brain is more lateralized with a right bias. Starting with pioneer studies of Diamond et al. !!!REF!!! sex differences in spatial learning have been reported (e.g., !!!REFs!!!) and attributed to changes in the hippocampus (e.g., !!!REFs!!!. Tabibnia et al. !!!REF!!! confirmed previously reported findings of sex differences in the volume of the granule cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus (i.e., larger in males than females) and also reported that GCL is asymmetrical in a sexually dimorphic manner; males have greater GCL volume in the right than in the left hemisphere whereas the asymmetry is not observed in females. Consequently, employing response strategies in place learning also accommodates lateralized responses and can be expected to be sexually dimorphic. Nicotinic receptors are present in brain regions critical for cognitive function and addiction. Although the prevalence of tobacco smoking has declined over the past 30 years, the decline has been less pronounced in women than in men. The cognitive effects of nicotine may be a critical factor in the decision to smoke and sex differences in the central actions of nicotine may be instrumental in understanding and coping with tobacco addiction !!!REF!!!. Nicotine eliminates the sex differences observed in strategies involved in a place learning task in the WM; nicotine-treated females behave like males !!!REF!!!. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous biological messenger molecule in the central nervous system that has been proposed to mediate in the neurotoxic actions of glutamate and transsynaptic regulation, as well as in learning and memory processes !!!REF!!!. There are sex differences in the regional distribution of NO metabolites and also in the cognitive effects of NO !!!REF!!!. Kanit et al. have shown that cortical NO is negatively correlated with the female-type strategy employed in a WM place learning task !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present study was to develop a new experimental design to study response strategy in place learning in the WM, to compare response learning with visual cued learning and to examine the impact of sex and laterality. Considering the effects of nicotine and NO on cognitive strategy employed in solving place learning tasks and also the sex differences observed in these effects, nicotine and NOS inhibition were included in the study.  The rodent corticospinal (pyramidal) tract is one of the largest fiber pathways of the rodent brain !!!REFs!!!. It extends from the pyramidal cells of mediorostral neocortex, motor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex to innervate the striatum and a number of brainstem structures including the red nucleus and olivary complex !!!REFs!!! and terminate in all lamina of the spinal cord, especially motor layers VI and VII !!!REFs!!!. A portion of the pyramidal tract has its origin in the forelimb representations of motor cortex, the rostral forelimb area (RFA) and the larger caudal forelimb area (CFA) !!!REFs!!!. Intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) of these two regions induces contralateral limb and paw movements !!!REFs!!!. Two lines of evidence suggest that the ICMS representations provide an indication of the functionality of the corticospinal system. First, previous experience influences the size of the topographic representation of the forelimb as revealed by ICMS !!!REFs!!!. Second, damage to these regions by lesions or stroke results in impairments in forelimb use on tasks requiring skilled movements of the forelimb, such as retrieving food with the limb !!!REFs!!!. Consequently, the motor system and the pyramidal tract are of interest to investigators studying in the role of experience on motor function and plasticity in recovery of function !!!REFs!!!. Many studies of the pyramidal tract's role in motor control have involved complete lesions of the tract. Complete lesions of the pyramidal tract at the medullary pyramids in rodents impairs food handling with the forepaws, reaching for food with a forelimb (skilled reaching), and impairs rotatory movements of both the proximal and distal forelimb in skilled reaching !!!REFs!!!. Simpler movements such as over ground locomotion are spared !!!REFs!!!. The rodent impairments are similar to those reported in cats !!!REF!!! and primates !!!REFs!!!. Pyramidal tract lesions also abolish the forelimb movements typically obtained by microstimulation of motor cortex !!!REF!!!. Nevertheless, functional restitution has been reported with the sparing/regrowth of the pyramidal tract. For example, small portions of the tract spared by lesions is reported to produce recovery !!!REFs!!! and spontaneous sprouting or the promotion of sprouting is similarly associated with recovery !!!REFs!!!. These reports are interesting in that they suggest that only a small amount of sprouting or regrowth may be necessary to restore the function of the entire tract. They thus raise the question of how only a few fibers can mediate the function of the entire tract and how the forelimb motor cortex undergoes changes in order to mediate restored behavior. These questions were addressed in the present research. In the study, rats were trained on a skilled reaching task and then received no lesion, complete lesions of the pyramidal tract, or partial lesions of its medial, central, or lateral third. Their reaching success and their reaching movements were then examined over a 2-week recovery period. Following asymptotic postlesion performance was attained, the RFA and the CFA of the motor cortex was mapped using cortical microstimulation.  An emerging conceptual framework concerning the organization of learning and memory suggests that there are multiple memory systems that, in most situations, interact to influence behavior !!!REFs!!!. There are at least five different systems that seem to acquire and store different types of information about an experience. Two of these systems, the dorsal striatum and amygdala, are thought to be involved in the acquisition and storage of stimulus–response habits !!!REF!!! and stimulus–reward associations !!!REFs!!!, respectively. While these functions can be dissociated !!!REF!!!, possible interactions between these systems are the focus of the present research. Aside from its role in stimulus–reward associations, the amygdala has been implicated in the modulation of memory consolidation processes. Memory consolidation is a naturally occurring process whereby a neural representation becomes permanent over time !!!REFs!!!. The representation is thought to progress from an initially labile state to a more permanent state during which time artificial treatments (drugs, hormones, etc.) or naturally occurring events (fear states, food consumption, etc.) can strengthen or weaken (i.e., modulate) the consolidation process !!!REFs!!!. If rats are exposed to these treatments immediately after training on some task, they exhibit better performance than rats exposed to the same remforcer some time after training !!!REFs!!!. The memory modulating properties of these treatments on the consolidation process are inferred from the enhanced behavioral expression. The amygdala participates in the consolidation processes of newly acquired representations. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala complex !!!REFs!!! has been shown to disrupt the consolidation of recently acquired information, when the stimulation was applied immediately following behavioral training. Intra-amygdala injections of lidocaine !!!REF!!!, muscimol !!!REFs!!! or tetrodotoxin !!!REF!!! immediately after passive avoidance decreased retention latencies, when the rats were tested 24h later. Therefore, temporarily disrupting amygdala function during the consolidation process interferes with the storage of information. Post-training treatments aimed directly at the amygdala also enhance the consolidation process of newly acquired information !!!REFs!!!. Intra-amygdala injections of amphetamine immediately after training on a hidden or visible platform water task !!!REF!!! enhanced the retention of both tasks inferred from a decrease in the latency to escape to the platform 24h after the treatments. Intra-amygdala injection of lidocaine on the test day did not impair performance of either task while lidocaine injected into the hippocampus impaired the hidden platform task and lidocaine injections into the dorsal striatum impaired the visible platform task. This suggests that the amygdala modulated the consolidation of a representation stored in the hippocampus and dorsal striatum but no representation appeared to be modulated or stored in the amygdala !!!REF!!!. The present study was carried out to examine whether post-training treatments aimed directly at the amygdala modulate consolidation processes occurring in the dorsal striatum and/or within the amygdala. A task commonly used to study the mnemonic functions of the amygdala is the conditioned cue preference task (CCP). The task consists of Pavlovian presentations of a set of cues with food and a second, distinct set with no food. After training, a rat will approach and spend more time in the presence of the food-paired cues in the absence of food. Amygdala lesions !!!REFs!!! block expression of the CCP and post-training manipulations of the amygdala !!!REFs!!! impair retention of the CCP. This suggests that the amygdala memory system is critical for the consolidation and expression of the CCP. To examine whether post-training treatments directed at the amygdala modulate consolidation processes in the dorsal striatum and/or within the amygdala, post-training intra-amygdala amphetamine or saline injections were given during acquisition of a visual discrimination task. This task requires a rat to make an association between a stimulus (lit arm) and a response (turn and approach) to consistently receive a highly palatable reward (food). Previous work has shown that damage to the dorso-lateral striatum impairs acquisition of this task !!!REFs!!! and post-training manipulations directly into this brain structure enhance acquisition !!!REFs!!!. Acquisition of this task was not impaired following damage to the amygdala or hippocampus !!!REF!!!. Recent experiments provide direct evidence mat the amygdala acquired a stimulus–reward association during acquisition of the visual discrimination task !!!REFs!!!. The present experiments were designed to examine the effects of post-training amphetamine injections directly into the amygdala during the acquisition of a visual discrimination task developed for the eight-arm radial maze. Enhancement of the visual discrimination task is predicted based on previous work showing this effect using the same dose of amphetamine !!!REF!!!. The same rats were also tested on a transfer test modeled on the CCP task using the light that was paired with food during stimulus–response habit acquisition. Enhancement of the CCP was hypothesized to reflect modulation of a consolidation process within the amygdala memory system.  Trisomy-21 is the most common chromosome abnormality in humans, causing mental retardation and physical disorders due to overexpression of a large set of genes including !!!REFs!!!. encodes superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide !!!REF!!!. gene was the first chromosome 21 gene to be cloned !!!REF!!! and transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type human (SF-218 line) was the first genetic model modelling this syndrome !!!REF!!!. The mouse homologues for most of these genes are situated on chromosome 16 and several transgenic mouse models that mimic part of this disorder are available !!!REFs!!!. The Ts65D partial trisomy model overexpressing 104 genes between and had developmental delays in sensorimotor function and deficient spatial learning in the Morris water maze !!!REFs!!!. Other trisomic models have been used for the genetic dissection of specific phenotypes !!!REF!!!. The role of overexpressed has been linked both to beneficial and adverse actions !!!REF!!!. Primary cortical neuronal cultures of wild-type mice (SF-218 line) exposed to acute trauma (cold, contusion) were protected from ischemia/reperfusion relative to controls !!!REF!!!. Likewise, cultured midbrain neurons of the same wild-type model were less susceptible to decay over time than those of non-transgenic controls !!!REF!!!. Moreover, cortical neurons of a different wild-type model (KT line) survived better after exposure to certain neurotoxins !!!REF!!!. In wild-type transgenic rats, ventral horn motor neurons were more protected than wild-type from programmed cell death after traumatic spinal cord injury !!!REF!!! and CA1 hippocampal neurons were less vulnerable after global ischemia/reperfusion !!!REFs!!!. In addition, overexpression induced by an adenovirus-based vector protected rat superior cervical ganglion neurons grown in culture from nerve growth factor withdrawal !!!REF!!!. In regard to adverse actions, homozygous wild-type transgenic mice from KT and N29 lines developed mitochondrial vacuolization in ventral horn, cranial motor nuclei, and subiculum, as well as argyrophilic degeneration in ventral horn, spinocerebellar tracts, cerebellar white matter, ventrolateral caudal medulla, and fornix !!!REF!!!. This form of degeneration was accompanied by microgliosis and astrogliosis in spinal cord and brainstem. There was also an age-related α-motoneuron loss but without any sign of paresis. Moreover, these mice developed immunologic anomalies including premature thymic involution !!!REF!!!. Behavioral analyses of the homozygous N29 line revealed deficient motor coordination in the rotorod test. The hemizygous wild-type transgenic mice from the KT line were impaired in the stationary beam test and were hyposensitive to tactile and visual stimuli !!!REF!!!. A detrimental effect of overexpressed is also indicated by findings of abnormal activity patterns in the open-field and deficient spatial learning in the Morris water maze in yet another wild-type transgenic model (Tg-51) !!!REFs!!!. In the present study, we sought to determine whether exploratory activity and sensorimotor functions are altered in wild-type / transgenic mice from the KT line. These mice were generated by injecting human wild-type into fertilized eggs of the FVB/N strain under the control of its own promoter. The FVB/N strain is characterized by high motor activity in the open-field and home-cage turning wheel relative to the C57BL/6 strain !!!REFs!!! and retinal degeneration caused by a defect in the gene !!!REFs!!!, resulting in poor spatial orientation !!!REF!!!. Exploratory activity and anxiety were estimated by actimeter !!!REF!!!, elevated plus-maze !!!REFs!!!, and emergence !!!REF!!! tests. The photocell activity chamber measured horizontal activity, dissociating ambulatory from sterotyped movements, and rears. The elevated plus-maze contains two arms enclosed by walls and two arms open on all sides. General exploration is reflected by entries into enclosed arms and anxiety by entries into open arms and open/total ratios. The normal murine preference for enclosed areas was attenuated by anxiolytic agents such as the benzodiazepines !!!REFs!!!. In the emergence test, the tendency of mice to remain inside a small, safe compartment placed inside a larger one was estimated, a test sensitive to several null mutations in mice, including corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 !!!REFs!!!. All three tests measure different facets of exploratory activity, having in common the possibility of huddling near enclosed regions. The evaluation was completed by stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests of motor coordination. These tests are sensitive to genetic and experimentally induced lesions of motor-related pathways !!!REFs!!! as well as transgene-mediated anomalies in intermediate filaments !!!REFs!!! and wild-type overexpression !!!REFs!!! in mice. In the stationary beam test, the mice are placed on a narrow surface; the number of segments crossed and the latencies before falling are measured. In the coat-hanger test, the mice are suspended upside-down and movement times (MTs) before righting themselves and latencies before falling are measured. This test is more heavily dependent on muscle strength, as the mouse must support its own body weight. In the rotorod test, mice placed on a narrow beam are forced to locomote forward in synchrony to beam movement in order to avoid a fall.  Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are hereditary neurodegenerative disorders, known as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), caused by degeneration of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections. At least six of these SCAs represent a subgroup of the polyglutamine (polyGln) diseases, characterized as slow progressive and late onset neurodegenerative disorders !!!REF!!!. Huntington's disease and Kennedy disease, dentatorubro-pallido-Luysian and spinal bulbar muscular atrophies are among the polyGln diseases !!!REF!!!. The latter are caused by mutations in different genes, with no homologies except for the CAG repeat encoding the polyGln tracts. The expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the mutated gene produces expansion of the polyGln tract in proteins. This triggers a cascade of events, which are toxic only for a subset of neurons !!!REF!!!. Although genetic defects and coded proteins have been identified, little is known about pathogenetic mechanisms. Thus, various hypotheses have been suggested !!!REFs!!!. The issue is still controversial and the importance of studies on normal protein function, to better investigate the role of the mutated protein in degeneration, has often been stressed !!!REFs!!!. Expanded polyGln truncated tracts are reported to be more toxic than the entire mutated protein. This suggests that other factors besides the expansion of the polyGln tract intervene in determining the course and the features of polyGln diseases !!!REFs!!!. One of the most intriguing characteristics of expanded polyGln disorders, which supports the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms, is the specific regional neuronal degeneration exhibited by each individual disease despite the ubiquitous expression of many polyGln proteins !!!REF!!!. A clear example of the importance of regional selectivity is the specific and primary degeneration of Purkinje cells in almost all SCAs in spite of differences among the various mutated proteins !!!REF!!!. The presence of different degrees of secondary degeneration phenomena in precerebellar structures further stresses the importance of factors other than protein mutation. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by expansion of a polyGln tract in ataxin-2 (ax-2). The clinical features of SCA2 include ataxia and dysarthria, slow saccades, tremor, hypo- or areflexia, peripheral neuropathy and dementia !!!REF!!!. SCA2 histopathological picture reveals severe primary degeneration of Purkinje neurons followed by conspicuous neuronal loss and gliosis in the inferior olive and pons !!!REF!!!. Despite widespread ax-2 distribution in neural and non-neural tissues !!!REF!!!, the protein is not expressed by all classes of degenerating neurons !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, in the cerebellum ax-2 is expressed by less than 60% of Purkinje neurons in a scattered and uneven distribution !!!REF!!!. In addition, almost all granule, Golgi and basket cells, but not stellate and Lugaro cells, express ax-2. In SCA2, while almost all Purkinje cells degenerate without any indication of regional prevalence, granule cells, in spite of their ax-2 content, tend to be spared !!!REF!!!. Similarly, pontine and olivary degeneration occurs irrespective of the ax-2 content. Consequently, it can be inferred that cells in the cerebellar circuits degenerate independently of ax-2 content and that interactions between the mutated protein or its products and specific cellular metabolic pathways may trigger cell death. For instance, Purkinje and olivary neurons present intrinsic differences in their capacity to support axonal regeneration and to survive different insults !!!REF!!!. These differences have been related to the capacity to express specific proteins, such as growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) !!!REFs!!!, or to modify the pattern of purinergic receptor subtypes !!!REF!!!. In order to identify any possible specificities of ax-2-containing neurons in surviving insults, we analyzed the characteristics of cell reaction to axotomy in ax-2-positive precerebellar neurons in a model of cerebellar damage !!!REFs!!!. This model, which is represented by ablation of one cerebellar hemisphere, one half of the vermis, subcortical white matter and deep cerebellar nuclei, results not only in target ablation, but also in the transection of incoming axons.  Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been suggested to be associated with developmental disabilities !!!REFs!!!. Studies on the long-term effects of IUGR, such as mental performance and behavior have provided varying and often conflicting results. Most follow-up studies have focused on cognitive and sensory motor functioning of IUGR children. However, deficits were also found in gross motor behaviors as measured in coordination and proprioceptive tasks as well as strategy formation, spatial ability and non-verbal problem solving !!!REFs!!!. These neurological dysfunctions usually persist into school age and are often associated with poor school achievements !!!REFs!!!. The hippocampus is a brain structure known to be susceptible to damage during pregnancy and it is vulnerable to a wide variety of neurological insults. As previous studies showed that low birth weight children are associated with low hippocampal volume !!!REF!!!, it is possible that the hippocampus volume also may be reduced in IUGR children. This anatomical abnormality in turn will lead to deficits in hippocampal-related behaviors !!!REF!!!. It is well-known that the hippocampus is a key structure in controlling spatial orientation. Many studies indicated that fully mature hippocampus is required in order to perform well in spatial tasks !!!REFs!!!. The ability to represent space and spatial location of objects is vitally important to any mobile organism. Therefore, development of a child's spatial knowledge, is an essential part of his/her learning ability !!!REFs!!!. Little is known about the development of spatial behavior in children with IUGR, and its role in their described difficulties, although several studies with IUGR animal models have reported spatial deficits !!!REFs!!!. In animal studies, chronic placental insufficiency is used as a model for IUGR because this manipulation leads to abnormal brain development, including a significant reduction in hippocampus volume and changes in the dendrites morphology !!!REF!!!. The same damage was found in another model of IUGR, the reduction of blood supply to the brain !!!REF!!!. These authors found a delay in the hippocampal development and delayed maturation of the cholinergic system, which is important for normal performance in hippocampal-related behaviors, such as the radial arm maze. Two spatial tests were used in the present study: the radial arm maze (RAM) and Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC). In laboratory animals, the RAM is a well-established navigational task that is highly sensitive to hippocampal damage in both young and mature rats !!!REF!!!. RAM was recently introduced to human testing; the RAM has also been successfully used in normal children, for assessing spatial behavior and relational place learning !!!REFs!!!. This task, however, has not been used in high-risk groups such as children with IUGR. The second test was a well-standardized spatial memory subtest from the K-ABC !!!REF!!!. Both tests assess spatial memory and behavior, strategy formation and relational place learning. The aims of the study were, therefore, to compare the performance in the RAM and spatial memory K-ABC tests of IUGR children with those of control children. Another purpose of our study was to further validate the RAM as a diagnostic and research tool in humans.  Cocaine has a significant impact on several important neuronal systems, including the dopaminergic and opioidergic systems. The rewarding effects of cocaine are believed to be mediated by elevation of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), due to blockade of dopamine re-uptake into presynaptic neurons via the dopamine transporter. A similar blockade of dopamine re-uptake occurs in the caudate putamen (CPu). The rewarding and the locomotor-stimulating effects of cocaine derive, in part, from this increase in mesolimbic dopaminergic tone, while elevation of dopaminergic tone in the CPu is involved in mediating the development and expression of behavioral stereotypy (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Cocaine also affects the endogenous opioid system. Cocaine administration in rodents, non-human primates and humans has been shown to cause a significant increase in preprodynorphin (ppDyn) mRNA in the CPu (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). Our laboratory has reported that administration of cocaine, in a “binge” pattern, results in a significant increase of ppDyn mRNA in the caudate putamen following 1, 3, 8 or 14 days of administration (e.g. !!!REF!!!). The increase in dynorphin peptide in response to cocaine is closely related to dopaminergic stimulation of cAMP via the dopamine D1-like receptor (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). It has been postulated that dynorphin works in a counter-regulatory fashion to drive down dopaminergic tone via stimulation of the kappa opioid receptor (e.g. !!!REFs!!!). The striatum receives a strong innervation from sensory and motor cortical regions (e.g. !!!REFs!!!) and corticostriatal glutamatergic projections are also important mediators of ppDyn mRNA expression (e.g. !!!REF!!!). The cocaine-induced increase in ppDyn mRNA levels within the CPu has been shown to be graded, with the greatest increase in the dorsal region of the postcommissural striatum !!!REF!!!, a region which receives a strong innervation from the sensorimotor and medial agranuar cortex !!!REF!!!. Additionally, this striatal region has been suggested to, at least partially, mediate stimulus–response learning !!!REFs!!! and thus, may be important in the habitual nature of compulsive drug-seeking behavior and in the drug-induced repetitive expression of, otherwise, normal behaviors (e.g. behavioral stereotypy). A common feature of human cocaine abuse is the development, over time, of tolerance to the reinforcing effects of cocaine, which results in administration of increasing doses of cocaine. Also, animals trained to self-administer cocaine, under a fixed ratio of responding and given long access (i.e. 12h) and high doses, tend to escalate their intake of cocaine over days (e.g. !!!REF!!!). We have reported that the magnitude of the elevation of ppDyn mRNA was consistent regardless of duration of administration (1, 3 or 14 days) and over a dose range of 10, 30 or 45mg/kg/day (3.33, 10 or 15mg/kg/injection !!!REF!!!); however, we have not examined the effects of higher doses of cocaine on the expression of striatal ppDyn mRNA expression. Therefore, in order to more closely model the pattern of chronic cocaine abuse observed in humans and the pattern of cocaine self-administration observed under high-dose extended-access conditions in rodents, we modified our “binge” pattern of cocaine administration to include an escalation in the dose of cocaine administered during the course of a 14-day study. The present study was designed to compare the effects of chronic “binge” pattern administration of steady-dose versus escalating-dose “binge” cocaine on the expression of behavioral stereotypy and the levels of ppDyn mRNA in the NAc and CPu.  Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that bilateral prefrontal areas are engaged alongside the medial temporal lobes for the encoding and subsequent retrieval of episodes in long-term memory !!!REFs!!!. Unexpectedly, several of these studies have pointed to a hemispheric asymmetry. There was a prevalence of activity in the left prefrontal cortex during the encoding of verbal and spatial materials !!!REFs!!!, while an enhanced activity was present in the right prefrontal cortex during the retrieval of that information content. These findings have led Tulving et al. !!!REF!!! to propose a general model of brain function subserving episodic memory. According to the hemispheric encoding-retrieval asymmetry (HERA) model, the left hemisphere plays a crucial role in encoding, while the right hemisphere is dominant for retrieval !!!REF!!!. In line with the HERA model, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the prefrontal cortex has been able to temporarily interfere with the encoding and consecutive retrieval of both visuospatial !!!REF!!! and verbal !!!REF!!! episodes. It should be remarked that the HERA pattern is not an absolute feature of cortical activity during long-term memorization. Rather, the level or existence of the HERA pattern is affected and in some cases abolished by the nature of the material to be memorized, such as verbal content, difficulty, familiarity, level of detail, etc. !!!REFs!!!. Beyond the issue of its generalization, the HERA model has been able to explain the experimental data produced by a design in which young adults were asked to remember a set of pictures representing interiors of apartments (“interiors”) and landscapes (“landscapes”; !!!REF!!!). That design has been also utilized by a recent electroencephalographic (EEG) study aimed at evaluating the role of brain rhythms in the processes of encoding and retrieval, in the light of the predictions of the HERA model !!!REF!!!. In that study, the HERA model was only fitted by EEG gamma responses (about 40Hz) observed in an unexpected posterior location. The encoding phase was associated with a magnitude increment of the gamma EEG oscillations over the left parietal cortex. Instead, the retrieval phase was associated with the magnitude increment of the gamma EEG oscillations predominantly over the right parietal cortex. Summarizing, the amplitude of the parietal but not frontal gamma rhythms fitted the hemisphere-condition combination of the HERA model. Why did not frontal cortex entrain into the modulation of the gamma response in line with HERA model? The issue was crucial since HERA model was constructed on the basis of prefrontal activity during encoding-retrieval processes, as revealed by the mentioned neuroimaging and TMS studies !!!REFs!!!. This discrepancy was explained as due to the differential sensitivity of neuroimaging methods to different components of long-term episodic memory. In particular, the strict relation between the EEG gamma responses and perception suggested that the retrieval processes of long-term memory may be deeply impinged upon the sensory representations of the stored material in the parietal lobe. In explaining the results of the mentioned EEG study !!!REF!!!, we could not exclude a remote functional control of the prefrontal over parietal areas in the modulation of the gamma rhythms during the encoding and retrieval processes. Indeed, that EEG study !!!REF!!! has just disclosed the topographical distribution of brain reactivity during the task, without testing whether the frontal and parietal areas were working in parallel or in series with a precise hierarchy (i.e. one is being functionally more relevant than the other within the whole network). A reasonable reconciliatory hypothesis was that the parietal gamma rhythms (following HERA model) would be functionally interrelated to the frontal gamma rhythms. We could not address that hypothesis at the time of the previous study !!!REF!!!. Indeed, our implementation of the required methodological approach had not been yet fully validated. The present EEG study re-analyzed the EEG data recorded in the previous study !!!REF!!!, in order to test the working hypothesis that the parietal gamma rhythms (following HERA model) were functionally coordinated to the frontal gamma rhythms during the encoding and retrieval processes. Global fronto-parietal coupling was estimated by spectral coherence, whereas the “direction” of the fronto-parietal information flow was estimated by directed transfer function (DTF). It should be remarked that no coherence and DTF finding was published in the previous study !!!REF!!!, so that the present results are entirely original and unedited. Concerning the present methodological approach, EEG spectral coherence between pairs of cortical regions have been interpreted as an evidence of functional coupling !!!REFs!!!, mutual information exchange !!!REF!!!, functional co-ordination !!!REF!!!, and integrity of connection pathways !!!REF!!!. In addition, DTF estimates have been proved to roughly model the “direction” of the information flow between pairs of cortical sites !!!REFs!!!.  As assessed by a number of clinical reports and neuropsychological studies, schizophrenia is often characterised by the breakdown of cognitive control of action and by the presence of disorganised and socially inappropriate behaviour. Disturbances of action production in patients with schizophrenia have been observed in various forms: poverty of action, disorganised behaviour, stereotyped and incoherent actions, omissions or commission errors. Frith et al. !!!REFs!!! have proposed that different symptoms of schizophrenia may be associated with specific deficits in the internal monitoring of self-generated actions and one's own intentions. According to this view, disorganisation symptoms or delusions of control reflect a defective central monitoring of willed actions. This impairment is characterised either as failure to monitor the intention to act, or as difficulties in initiating an action. According to Frith's model !!!REF!!!, a defective ability to attribute intentions and mental states to other people, termed “Theory of Mind” (ToM), could explain social and interpersonal dysfunctioning in schizophrenic individuals affected by reality distortion or paranoid symptoms !!!REF!!!. Further behavioural studies have supported the notion of an underlying defective mechanism of intention attribution and mentalising abilities in patients with schizophrenia !!!REFs!!!. Mazza et al. !!!REF!!! observed that patients with psychomotor poverty symptom performed worse than patients with disorganisation and reality distortion symptoms on first and second order ToM stories. Pickup and Frith !!!REF!!! found that patients with behavioural signs performed poorly on second order false belief tasks even when memory and IQ, severity of psychopathology and duration of illness were controlled. Only in schizophrenic patients with paranoid symptoms poor ToM performance was associated with low IQ. Sarfati et al. !!!REF!!! presented schizophrenic patients with short comic strips showing a character performing an action. Participants were asked to select the appropriate and congruous card among four proposed on the basis of the character's volitional states, such as desires and intentions. The authors reported that schizophrenic patients with thought and language disorder were impaired in completing the task and concluded that only these patients manifested a deficit in action planning and ToM abilities, whereas schizophrenic patients without disorganisation symptoms or depressed and manic subjects do not !!!REFs!!!. By using two control tasks consisting in understanding physical events, Brunet et al. !!!REF!!! showed that schizophrenic patients with formal thought disorders were selectively impaired in attributing intentional states to others. Although these findings strongly suggest the idea of a link between action disorders and mentalising impairments in schizophrenia, they do not help disentangling performance in planning ( and ; see !!!REF!!!) and in ToM (attribution of mental states) abilities in patients with disorganisation symptoms. Therefore, it is still unclear whether poor performance of these patients would reflect a specific deficit in ToM or a defective ability in representing goal-directed action. In Langdon et al.'s !!!REF!!! study, a picture-sequencing task was used to test the hypothesis of a selective impairment of schizophrenic patients in understanding ToM stories. The results showed that impaired ToM abilities are associated with negative behavioural signs of schizophrenia, such as flat affects, social withdrawal and alogia, rather than reality distortion, as previously found by Frith and Corcoran !!!REF!!! or thought disorganisation as in Sarfati et al.'s studies !!!REFs!!! and Brunet et al.'s study !!!REF!!!. In contrast, patients with psychomotor poverty and reality distortion symptoms manifested a general sequencing impairment. According to these authors, general sequencing difficulties result from two distinct mechanisms: the inability to manipulate symbolic representations, associated with psychomotor poverty symptoms, which would lead to difficulties in planning behaviour, and failures to evaluate plausible cause–effect relations, which is related to reality distortion. Taken together, these studies have discounted the hypothesis of a general mentalising deficit in schizophrenia since only a subgroup of patients appears to show ToM difficulties. Moreover, there is little consensus about the relation between ToM and symptomatology as well as about the specificity of this deficit. As pointed out by Brüne !!!REF!!!, in most studies assessing ToM abilities, the effect of IQ and the duration of disorder remain ambiguous. According to this author, ToM dysfunction in schizophrenia might reflect a general intellectual retardation or increased working memory demands, rather than a selective impairment in mentalising abilities. In a previous study !!!REF!!!, we investigated the ability of patients with schizophrenia to organise action knowledge and elaborate a plan of action, as compared to normal subjects and to patients with frontal lobe lesions. The study consisted in two experiments: an action verbal generation task and an action-sequencing task. In the first experiment, similar to a word fluency task, participants were asked to verbally generate in the appropriate order a list of component actions that one usually performs to accomplish a familiar activity. Schizophrenic patients performed significantly worse than both normal subjects and frontal lobe patients in the semantic retrieval of action knowledge. Similarly to patients with frontal lobe lesions, they encountered difficulties in action sequencing and in setting priorities among action events with regard to the stated goal. The second experiment did not involve learning novel sequences or monitoring sequentially presented stimuli in working memory. Subjects had to arrange in the appropriate order cards on which component actions belonging to different familiar sequences were written. Interestingly, although the number of sequence errors increased in the presence of distractor elements or when the headers (the themes’ sequence) were not available, performance of schizophrenic patients did not substantially improved when context information was provided and working memory demands were minimised. These findings suggested that patients with schizophrenia are impaired in the sequential organisation of action events and that this impairment is relatively independent of working memory loads. However, while patients with frontal lobe lesions were generally impaired in action sequence processing, only a subgroup of schizophrenic patients committed sequencing errors in the verbal generation task. Unfortunately, because of the small sample of our schizophrenic group, no relation was observed between syndrome scores and task performance. In a more recent study !!!REF!!!, we asked schizophrenic patients to segment two video-taped sequences of familiar actions in meaningful event units by pressing a button when they thought that a perceived event was ending and another one was beginning. While watching the tape, subjects’ attention was monitored toward small or large events of the action hierarchy. Disorganisation symptoms and formal thought disorders correlated with a defective performance in the perceptual organisation of large segments of dynamic action while the ability to discern small acts, in which the temporal dimension is considerable reduced, was relatively preserved. The same patients recalled the event scenes in a detailed and fragmentary manner as compared to normal controls. These findings indicated that patients’ difficulties in identifying large action units would reflect an impairment in perceiving human goal-directed behaviour as sequences of structured and cohesive actions. A defective ability to represent complex events may also contribute to explain disturbances of action monitoring, social inadequacies and mentalising deficits in schizophrenic patients with disorganisation symptoms. The aim of the present study was to clarify some findings in this area: (1) to examine the relation between the disorganisation symptoms and performance on sequencing tasks related to different domains of knowledge; (2) to disentangle disorganised schizophrenic patients’ performance in representing goal-directed action and mentalising abilities. As showed in previous studies !!!REFs!!! successful performance in planning and monitoring a coarse of actions depends on the preserved ability to manipulate action knowledge. Action representation typically follows a script or a story syntax structure, e.g. a temporally organised sequence of events contained within boundaries defining the beginning and end points. Such properties that scripts are thought to possess can be used to provide a framework for the analysis of selective impairments in action knowledge following brain lesions or dysfunction !!!REFs!!!. Goals and intentions can be discerned at multiple levels of analysis: from the level of elementary sensory motor acts to the highest level of global intention. As posit by Baron-Cohen's !!!REF!!! model, the system of ToM partly relies on an , a perceptual device that interprets motion stimuli in terms of the primitive volitional mental states, such as goals and desires. The representation of the action sequence structure and the detection of the higher-level goals are crucial aspects for understanding others’ actions and can be considered as cognitive precursors of the more complex and sophisticated ToM ability. Our sequencing tasks including different types of actions allow discerning performance at different levels of the intentional action understanding. The task consisted in arranging cards depicting different types of events in the correct temporal order: (1) behavioural stories describing a person performing object-related actions (small actions); (2) behavioural stories describing a person performing actions in a broader context (large actions); (3) describing a person-to-person interaction; (4) stories; (5) physical events or objects interacting with each other. Behavioural sequences (types 1 and 2) are based on the abilities to understand the action's goal and to establish cause–effect relations between the component actions belonging to the plan. These are two crucial features of the action planning. Social-scripts required the understanding of the shared goal, the character's role and the conventional rules, whereas physical events are appropriately organised according to mechanical or physical causal laws. The false-belief stories are typically used to assess mentalising abilities since the character's behaviour can be understood on the basis of her/his false belief about the current state of affairs. On the contrary, behavioural and social-script stories cannot be considered as a stringent test on mentalising abilities since the characters’ beliefs coincide with reality and it is hard to tell whether the character's behaviour is understood on the basis of his/her beliefs or of physical reality. Based on our previous results, we expected schizophrenic patients who exhibit formal thought disorder to be more impaired in processing goal-directed knowledge (e.i., behavioural, social actions) as well as in ToM stories, as compared to schizophrenic patients without disorganisation symptoms. This impairment, which would consist either in a greater number of sequence errors or in increased difficulties in identifying the overall goal, could be less severe when dealing with object-related actions (small actions) as compared to more complex information processing (e.i., large, social, and ToM stories). It is widely known that schizophrenic patients performance get worse on cognitively effortful conditions or when they have to maintain task relevant or goal relevant information at long delay !!!REF!!!. On the contrary, event sequencing ability of patients without disorganisation symptoms is expected to be relatively preserved.  First, Moroni and coworkers have shown the presence of -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors for glutamic acid in the guinea pig myenteric plexus !!!REFs!!!. During the last decade evidence has accumulated that glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system (ENS) !!!REFs!!!. Meanwhile, Wiley et al. !!!REF!!! have demonstrated that glutamate can initiate muscle contraction via activation of NMDA receptors, which are coupled to c-AMP-dependent release of acetylcholine (ACh). NMDA receptor immunoreactivity was estimated in the esophageal plexus by Robertson et al. !!!REF!!!. Moreover, they found that all NMDAR-positive nerve cell bodies also contained immunoreactivity for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and some were immunoreactive for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Therefore, the authors suggested that NMDA receptor activation might be associated with the release of VIP or nitric oxide (NO). In addition, evidence has been obtained for glutamate excitotoxicity in the ENS !!!REF!!!. However, the physiological significance of the enteric glutamatergic transmitter system and its interactions with other neurotransmitters are not fully understood. The aim of our study was to clarify the role of enteric glutamate receptors in the modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission from myenteric plexus of guinea pig ileum.  In the last few years, several laboratories have focused their attentions on the investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of taurine, a well known sulfonic amino acid abundantly distributed in different tissues including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) area. These concerns come from the multiple and surprising effects exerted by taurine, such as functioning as a modulator of neural activity, being involved in osmoregulation and cell volume adjustments !!!REF!!!. Taurine modulates calcium movements through membranes !!!REF!!! inhibits protein phosphorylation !!!REF!!! and is also essential for the development and survival of neural cells !!!REF!!!. In physiological conditions, taurine is highly cumulated in neurons at concentration of 5–70mM !!!REFs!!!, and is released in high amounts under various pathologic conditions such as ischemia or anoxia and seizures !!!REFs!!!. Previous study has demonstrated that taurine is released from neurons in the upper dorsal horn layers, an area known to process nociceptive input !!!REF!!!. Systemic and intrathecal administration of taurine is analgesic in some acute pain tests !!!REFs!!!. It has been suggested that taurine may be a natural neuroprotectant against input excitotoxicity !!!REF!!!, and this input excitotoxicity is believed to trigger neuropathic pain !!!REF!!!. However, the potential role of taurine in suppressing neuropathic pain has not been determined. There are a number of electrophysiological studies indicating that taurine exerts its actions by interacting with different ion channels !!!REFs!!!, including Na+ channels. For example, Satoh and Sperelakis !!!REFs!!! have reported that in embryonic chick cardiomyocytes, taurine inhibits the fast Na+ current, L-type Ca2+ current and also inhibits the delayed outward K+ current at pCa 7. In adult rabbit ventricular myocytes, taurine causes a block of Na+ channels. Taurine also reduces Na+ current in single ventricular myocytes of guinea pigs !!!REFs!!!. However, currently few data may have been available on the action of taurine on Na+ channels widely expressed in neural system, including DRG. This point may be neglected because of the preferential regard to the neuroinhibitory action of taurine by activating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine receptors !!!REF!!!. Since there is no native glycine receptors in DRG neurons and DRG neurons do not respond to taurine !!!REF!!!, we wondered whether taurine could exert some apparent effects on Na+ channels in DRG neurons as that in cardiomyocytes. Because voltage-sensitive Na+ channels are critical determinants of membrane excitability !!!REF!!! and many changes in them are associated with traumatic nerve damages !!!REFs!!!, our study may provide a new mechanistic explanation for the taurine-modulated membrane stabilization involved in neural protection and a theoretical basis for the therapeutic application of this amino acid.  Morphological and physiological data point to the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the classical Loeschcke's area, as a possible origin for respiratory responses to acid–base stimulation !!!REFs!!!. This area in the rat comprises neurons located near the ventral surface of the medulla, in a rostrocaudal extent from the lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) to the beginning of the inferior olive nucleus (IO) at the level of the pyramidal decussation. This area has also been described as the caudal parapyramidal (Ppy) area !!!REFs!!! and is involved in central chemoreception as well as the rostral Ppy area !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, Berquin et al. !!!REF!!! showed that medullary neurons activated in response to hypercapnia were only found in the Ppy area, near the medullary surface. Since these neurons could be sensitive to H+ or CO2 !!!REF!!!, the hypercapnic stimulation should induce an increase in c-Fos expression in them. In the present work, we have examined by means of morphological and physiological techniques the caudal Ppy area of the rat brain. For clarity, we have subdivided the Ppy area of the caudal ventrolateral medulla into a medial region (MedPpy), which lies closest to the pyramidal tract, and a lateral region (LatPpy), situated beneath the LRt. The area encompassing MedPpy and LatPpy forms a continuum on the ventral surface of the caudal ventrolateral medulla, so that it is of interest to study the pattern of connectivity of both regions. Nevertheless, neurons in both regions could belong to the same cell population based on their histochemical and physiological properties. There is also direct evidence that some serotonergic medullary neurons are central CO2/pH chemoreceptors !!!REF!!!. As would be expected if serotonergic neurons were important as chemoreceptors, inhibition or depletion of these neurons leads to blunting of the CO2 ventilatory response !!!REFs!!!. Taking into account that serotonergic neurons fire tonically in alert animals, these neurons may thus provide a tonic drive to the respiratory network during wakefulness !!!REF!!!. On the other hand, facilitation of the responsiveness of these neurons increases the ventilatory response to CO2 !!!REF!!!. A high density of serotonin-immunoreactive nerve terminals was identified within the main respiratory nuclei, including the nucleus of the solitary tract (Sol), and the phrenic motor, ambiguus and hypoglossal nuclei !!!REFs!!!. Since functional and morphological data !!!REFs!!! point to the caudal Ppy area as a possible origin for respiratory responses to acid–base stimulation, we performed experiments to identify neurons with chemoreceptor characteristics in this region. Here, to stimulate neurons assumed to be chemoreceptors, we have microiontophoretically injected H+ into the caudal Ppy area of spontaneously breathing, anaesthetized rats with an intact respiratory system. We also sought to identify serotonergic neurons in the caudal Ppy area, and in the event of their presence, to determine if the efferent projections of this area terminate within respiration-related medullary nuclei. These experiments enabled us to identify a group of neurons located in the caudal Ppy area, different from those of the rostral area, which presented with a unique functional and morphological identity.  In the pioneering work of Belen’kii et al., during a rapid flexion of the arm while standing, several of the leg and trunk muscles were activated prior to the prime mover of the anterior deltoid muscle !!!REF!!!, which is considered to serve to maintain postural equilibrium against the disturbance due to reaction forces produced by arm movement and the displacement of the center of mass caused by a change in body configuration !!!REF!!!. They also showed that both the biceps femoris muscles of the contralateral side to the arm moved, and the rectus femoris muscles of the ipsilateral side were activated late after the onset of the anterior deltoid muscle. Many investigations focused on components preceding the prime mover !!!REFs!!!, while later components remain unstudied. In association with rapid and symmetrical movements of the bilateral arms during standing, the leg and trunk muscles are also activated alternately in the antagonistic muscles !!!REF!!!, which is analogous to the alternate activation of antagonistic muscles upon rapid movements of a single joint (e.g., !!!REF!!!). The initial adjustments of standing posture with rapid arm movements, called anticipatory postural adjustments, are in the direction opposite to the reaction forces associated with the arm acceleration !!!REF!!!. However, the arm(s) once accelerated must be decelerated towards the end of the arm movement, which generates reaction forces again but in an opposite direction. Hence, the standing posture should be adjusted to the reaction forces in the deceleration of the arm(s) as well as the acceleration. The later component in the study of Belen’kii et al. !!!REF!!! was possibly related to the deceleration of the arm. From a mechanical perspective, there are complex reaction forces at the shoulder during arm movements while standing, in which the force to rotate the trunk is included. However, adjustments of standing posture to trunk rotation associated with arm movements have not been studied specifically. Arm movements such as raising a single arm have a force component to rotate the upper trunk around a vertical axis. However, it is difficult to determine the effects on the trunk rotation, because in the arm movement the rotational force is moderate in magnitude, and the effects would be indistinguishable from those of the other forces. When both arms are moved simultaneously and asymmetrically in the sagittal plane, the trunk rotation is enhanced by the bilateral movements of the arms while minimizing the displacement of the center of gravity, which is deductive from the forces acting between the arms and trunk !!!REF!!!. One such movement is to swing the arms in opposite directions, like the arm movement while walking in place. The present study was designed to investigate how the trunk rotation, produced by the rapid and asymmetrical movement of the arms, is adjusted by contractions of the trunk and thigh muscles to maintain the upright standing posture, focusing on the termination of the arm movement as well as the initiation. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) of the trunk and thigh muscles were recorded simultaneously with the trunk movements and torque in the force-plate. The magnitude of the rotational force external to the trunk was manipulated by increasing the amplitude of the arm movement and by holding dumbbells in the hands.  The lipophilic indocarbocyanine dye DiI has revolutionized single color fiber tracing in fixed nervous system since its introduction in 1987 !!!REFs!!! resulting in over 1500 citations in the last 17 years. Several blue-excited lipophilic dyes exist (DiA, DiO !!!REFs!!!; ) that allow double labeling, albeit with variable degrees of difficulty and/or success. Some researchers reported that these dyes allowed them to image partial segregation of two labeled neuronal profiles !!!REF!!!, while others reported several problems that were incompletely resolved or not resolvable using DiI in combination with DiA or DiO. Some of the problems arise from the inability to segregate DiA completely from DiI in conventional epifluorescence microscopy: DiA's substantial Stokes shift causes significant overlap of its emission with that of DiI (see !!!REF!!! ). For reasons that remain poorly defined, DiO diffuses very slowly in fixed tissue, making it impractical for use as a long-range tracer. DiA, although somewhat better than DiO, has limited usefulness as a long-range tracer. Complete filling of profiles more than 5mm away is achieved only after excessively long diffusion times and the use of elevated temperatures (>36°C) increases diffusion speed but can result in other problems such as transcellular diffusion !!!REFs!!!. In addition, two-color studies with DiA and DiI are complicated by the fact that different diffusion times are required to label neuronal profiles completely !!!REFs!!!. As a consequence, detailed knowledge of diffusion distances per 24h in embryos of varying size/maturation stage is required for successful two-color studies using the DiA/DiI dye combination. Previous studies suggested that some of these problems could be overcome by using PKH2 (Zynaxis/Phanos) instead of DiA or DiO when using conventional epifluorescence microscopy !!!REFs!!!. However, this dye is not commercially available in crystalline form and its use still does not overcome the basic problem common to all green-emitting dyes that autofluorescence of neuronal tissue is particularly strong in the 450–490nm excitation wavelength band. A better solution is provided by the recent availability of single photon confocal microscopy, which allows use of near infrared excitation using either the 647nm band of the krypton/argon laser or the 637nm band of the red diode laser. Use of dyes that excite in this region results in a better signal to noise ratio than is possible with dyes that excite in the 450–500nm range, since tissue autofluorescence is much lower in the near infrared region of the spectrum. Indeed, previous work has identified a near infrared dye (DiD) with diffusion and imaging properties comparable to those of DiI !!!REF!!!. In this study, Agmon et al. !!!REF!!! successfully traced cortical fibers to their origin in nearby thalamic nuclei. Somewhat surprisingly, DiD has been relatively little used for double labeling (only 32 citations in the 9 years since Agmon's publication). In part this may be related to the poor visibility of this dye to the naked eye, and the consequent requirement for either single photon lasers or infrared sensitive cameras to detect its fluorescence. While single photon confocal microscopy expands the range of usable wavelengths into the near infrared spectrum, it also limits the available excitation bands to the emission bands of the strongest, most commonly used laser, the 488, 568 and 647nm emission bands of the Kr/Ar laser as well as the recently available infrared (637nm) and blue (405nm) diode. Indeed, the Alexa probes (conjugated to antibodies or to dextrans; Molecular Probes) have been tailored to fit those available emission bands with their excitation maxima. Conjugated with 3000 or 10,000 MW dextrans, these dyes allow for two or three-color labeling of neuronal profiles in live neurons !!!REFs!!!. The dextrans are also excellent for tracing of normal or of regenerating adult neuronal connections !!!REF!!! as well as very small developing non-mammalian embryos !!!REFs!!!. However, their otherwise excellent capacity for neuronal tracing !!!REF!!! is somewhat compromised by the limited viability of embryos outside the womb and the need for a diffusion time of at least 1 or more hours !!!REF!!!. The time required to genotype some mutants also imposes some limitations on the use of dextrans for studies of neuronal connections in the many knock-out, knock-in and transgenic mouse mutants generated by the developmental biology revolution of the 1990s. These new models have the potential to provide unsurpassed insights into how the developing mammalian brain is assembled. Moreover, with the completion of the mouse genome project, chances for transferability of mouse data to humans offers a unique, indirect insight into human neuronal development. In the present study we provide details for the use of three new carbocyanine dyes that resolve some of the above problems. Their excitation maxima closely match the wavelengths available on the most commonly used confocal microscopes systems (Kr/Ar laser, infrared diode lasers), enabling efficient excitation with standard laser lines. We describe the use of these dyes in a format that allows simple and completely segregated double and, under certain circumstances, triple labeling using near-simultaneous applications in embryos and juveniles. We also demonstrate their usefulness to resolve connectional problems in developmental neurobiology that are difficult to address by other techniques.  When neural cells are under oxidative stress, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced that induce neuronal death. This neuronal death is related to a variety of neuronal degenerative disorders that are caused by aging, cerebrovascular injury and neuropathology !!!REFs!!!. Most neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are closely associated with oxidative damage, as suggested by many studies !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, naturally occurring cell death is related to ROS !!!REF!!!. Cystatin C, a member of family 2 of the cystatin superfamily, is an alkaline protein with an apparent molecular mass of 13.5kDa that inhibits the activity of the lysosomal cysteine proteinases, cathepsin B, H and L !!!REFs!!!. The cystatin C protein is widely expressed in almost all tissues, including the brain, and is secreted into various biological fluids, including urine, semen, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid !!!REF!!!. Immunohistochemical studies have revealed that in the brains of rats, monkeys and humans, cystatin C is expressed mainly in astrocytes, in addition to weak and variable staining in some neurons !!!REF!!!. High levels of cystatin C mRNA have also been detected in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum of rodent brains !!!REF!!!. We have previously revealed that cystatin C mRNA and protein are remarkably up-regulated in rat cerebral cortical neurons cultured in a 50% oxygen atmosphere, which induces apoptosis, demonstrating that cystatin C is implicated in oxidative stress-induced cell death of CNS neurons !!!REF!!!. Studies on oxidative stress in vivo support that cystatin C is implicated in some neuronal diseases. Cystatin C-positive neurons are abundant in the cerebral cortex of some elderly people and AD patients, whereas in the normal brain cystatin C-immunoreactivity is found mainly in astrocytes, rather than in neurons !!!REFs!!!. In AD brains, cystatin C-immunoreactivity is primarily limited to pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III and V, where neurons are most susceptible to cell death in AD !!!REF!!!. Cystatin C also accumulates within beta-amyloid deposits in AD brains !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, polymorphisms in the cystatin C gene are associated with late-onset AD !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, a mutation in the cystatin C gene is related to hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-icelandic type !!!REF!!!. In ALS, cystatin C-immunoreactivity is intense in small eosinophilic intraneuronal inclusions within the remaining lower motor neurons, the Bunina bodies, which are a specific pathological hallmark of ALS !!!REF!!!. In transient ischemia, the delayed death of CA1 pyramidal neurons shows apoptotic features !!!REF!!!. In this case, immunoreactivity for cystatin C, as well as immunoreactivity for cathepsins B, H and L, whose activities are inhibited by cystatin C, is increased in the CA1 pyramidal neurons !!!REFs!!!. Cathepsins B and D leak into cytosolic regions of the cell because of a variety of oxidative stresses that induce destabilization of the lysosomal membrane; this cathepsin leakage leads to the release of cytochrome from mitochondria, and consequently induces cell death !!!REFs!!!. Considering that cystatin C inhibits the cathepsins, these studies strongly suggest the possibility that cystatin C prevents the neuronal cell death by inhibiting the cathepsins penetrated into cytosolic region, but it remains unclear what role cystatin C plays in these diseases. In the present study, to clarify the role cystatin C plays in neuronal death caused by oxidative stress, we established the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line that stably expressed rat cystatin C and evaluated the resistance of these cells to various oxidative stresses.  Neuroglial cells were long believed to simply provide structural support for neurons. However, evidence has now accumulated to show that these cells closely and actively interact with neurons in most functions of the nervous system (e.g. see !!!REF!!!). As a result, interest in neuroglial cells and their interactions with neurons has greatly increased. We have been studying the neuroglial cells that envelope the neurons in sensory ganglia for many years (for reviews, see !!!REFs!!!). These cells are usually called satellite cells and will be referred to as such in what follows. The satellite cells comprising a given perineuronal sheath are coupled to each other via gap junctions !!!REFs!!!. Gap junctions are important because they make possible metabolic cooperation between cells (e.g. see !!!REFs!!!) which in turn enhances the efficiency of satellite cells in their role of meeting the demands of the neurons with which they are associated. Information on age-related changes of the gap junctions between perineuronal satellite cells is still incomplete. In this study, we report our findings on gap junctions in the spinal ganglia of rabbits from the young to the extremely advanced age.  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting cognitive functions and memory. It is widely accepted that the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (βAP), a small peptide which derives from the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is central to the pathogenesis of disease !!!REF!!!. Although, the potential neurotoxic properties of βAP have been known for over a decade, it is still not known how βAP participates in a pathologic cascade resulting in progressive cognitive decline !!!REF!!!. Recently, it was shown that neuronal activity modulates the formation and secretion of βAP !!!REF!!!. It was also demonstrated that βAP selectively depresses excitatory synaptic transmission, therefore, it was proposed that activity-dependent modulation of endogenous βAP production may normally participate in a negative feedback that could keep neuronal hyperactivity in check !!!REF!!!. However, βAP, which is detected in nano-molar concentrations in healthy individuals throughout life both in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma !!!REF!!!, is thought to play a key role in normal physiology, including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, APP and its homologues display a high degree of evolutionary conservation, and have been detected in all mammals, and also in some invertebrates !!!REFs!!!. Nevertheless, no Alzheimer-like pathology has ever been described in animals. It is clear from the available literature that APP fragments, including βAP, can exert a powerful regulation of key neural functions including cell excitability, synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, both acutely and in the long-run. Furthermore, there is a small but growing literature confirming that these fragments correspondingly regulate behavioral learning and memory (for review, see !!!REF!!!). Because the 11-amino acid fragment βAP25–35 has been proposed to be the functional domain of βAP !!!REF!!!, in the present paper we examined the influence of this neurotoxic fragment on long-term sensitization of command neurons in isolated central nervous system of terrestrial snail (). In behavioral experiments, we tested in intact snails whether the tentacle withdrawal response, which is under the control of command neurons, is changed by βAP25–35 injections, and whether learning with noxious reinforcement is impaired in snails injected with βAP25–35.  Lethargy, anorexia and social withdrawal represent a constellation of symptoms, collectively referred to as . This constellation represents a highly energy-conserving mechanism employed by the host to fight infection !!!REF!!!. Proinflammatory cytokines that are released in the periphery by activated immune cells appear to induce the symptoms of sickness behaviour. For example, peripheral interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), a potent proinflammatory cytokine, mediates the reduction in general motor activity !!!REFs!!!, food intake !!!REFs!!! and social exploration !!!REF!!!. Research has also suggested a role for systemic IL-1β in sickness-induced cognitive dysfunction, as tasks that have been demonstrated to be sensitive to hippocampal insult, such as the Morris water task !!!REFs!!! and contextual conditioning tasks !!!REFs!!! are also sensitive to systemic pharmacological manipulations of IL-1β !!!REFs!!!. For example, Gibertini demonstrated an IL-1β-induced spatial learning deficit in the Morris water task !!!REF!!!. More recently, Gibertini et al. observed that the effects of systemically administered IL-1β on spatial learning and memory are abolished if animals are subjected to variations in experimental protocol, including water temperature or dose !!!REF!!!. These more recent results suggest that IL-1β-induced spatial learning and memory impairments are not as robust as had been suggestsed by Gibertini's previous results !!!REF!!!. In learning and memory tasks that do not involve spatial navigation, the reports on the effects of systemic IL-1β on performance are similarly mixed. Pugh et al. !!!REF!!! observed that a post-learning systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent endotoxin that induces the release of IL-1β, impaired memory consolidation in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Moreover, Pugh et al. observed that the systemic administration of an IL-1β receptor antagonist blocked this impairment, suggesting that systemic IL-1β is the primary mediator of the memory consolidation disruption !!!REF!!!. However, this explanation is weakened by the observation that: systemic LPS also induces brain IL-1β activity !!!REF!!!; and brain IL-1β can disrupt learning and memory !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, IL-1β receptor antagonists readily cross the blood–brain barrier !!!REF!!!. It is conceivable that the systemic administration of an IL-1ra could abolish systemic LPS-induced impairments in memory consolidation by blocking the activity of IL-1β in the brain and not in the periphery. We, therefore, decided to directly test whether the systemic administration of IL-1β would disrupt memory consolidation. In our first experiment, we attempted to replicate Pugh et al.'s effects of post-learning administration of LPS on memory consolidation in a fear conditioning paradigm !!!REF!!!. Similar to Pugh et al. !!!REF!!!, we injected doses of LPS i.p. immediately following a 5-min exposure to a chamber in which animals received two tone-shock pairings. In experiment two, we followed the same protocol, but injected the animals with IL-1β i.p. rather than LPS. In both experiments, we tested for both context and tone retention 48h following the injection. The amount of freezing exhibited during the testing of context retention was used as a measure of how well the animals had retained a contextual representation of the original fear-inducing context, whereas the amount of freezing exhibited during the testing of tone retention was used as an index of how capable the animals were in mounting a freezing response independent of hippocampal functioning.  Adenosine is an important neuroactive nucleoside that exerts two parallel roles in the central nervous system (CNS), both as a homeostatic modulator and also as a modulator at the synaptic level !!!REF!!!. Adenosine modifies the release of neurotransmitters, the post-synaptic responsiveness and the action of a number of other neurotransmitter systems !!!REF!!!. In addition, adenosine and its analogues exhibit a variety of effects at the behavioural level, including sedation, anti-convulsant activity, anti-nociceptive effects, protection against post-ischaemic damage, and inhibition of aggression !!!REFs!!!. Adenosine also modulates cognitive states and is associated with affective and mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression !!!REFs!!!. It was recently demonstrated by our group that the administration of adenosine produces an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swimming test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice, two predictive models frequently used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs designed to treat depression !!!REF!!!. This effect is apparently mediated through an interaction with A1 and A2A receptors, since the anti-immobility effect of adenosine in the FST was reversed by the pre-treatment of mice with the A1 and A2A receptor antagonists DPCPX and ZM241385, respectively. Moreover, the treatment of mice with both A1 and A2A receptor agonists (CHA and DPMA, respectively) elicited an antidepressant-like effect in the FST similar to that observed after adenosine administration !!!REF!!!. Major depression is a severe disorder that involves disturbances of emotional, cognitive, autonomic and endocrine functions !!!REF!!!. The serotonergic system has been recognised as playing an important role, specifically in the aetiology of depression and drugs acting on the serotonergic system, have been largely implicated in the treatment of depressive disorders !!!REFs!!!. Evidence is accumulating for a critical involvement of serotonergic receptors, in particular 5-HT1A receptors, in the treatment of depression. The 5-HT1A receptors are located pre-synaptically in the raphe nuclei, and post-synaptically in limbic and cortical regions. These receptors act by inhibiting the firing rate of 5-HT neurons and they are particularly relevant to the antidepressant responses !!!REF!!!; besides that, major depressive disorder is associated with a widespread reduction in 5-HT1A receptor binding !!!REF!!!. There are several pieces of evidence showing that adaptive functional changes in 5-HT1A receptors are critically involved in the central action of antidepressants, including tricyclics, SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and MAOi (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) !!!REF!!!. Moreover, 5-HT1A partial agonists, such as buspirone, gepirone or tandospirone induce antidepressant effects !!!REFs!!!. The 5-HT2 receptors are also widely distributed throughout the brain, in a pattern that suggests that their activation may be implicated in the regulation of mood disorders !!!REF!!!. The regulation of 5-HT2 receptors, especially 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C subtypes, gained importance when some studies showed that the administration of antidepressant drugs caused a down-regulation of these receptors. Redrobe and Bourin !!!REF!!! showed that blockade of the 5-HT2 receptor leads to a potentiation of the antidepressant effects of imipramine in the FST. In addition, a few antidepressant drugs, such as nefazodone, trazodone and mirtazapine, are 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, a property that may underlie their therapeutic actions !!!REF!!!. Considering that (a) adenosine is able to modulate neuronal firing and 5-HT release, especially through A1 and A2A receptors activation, (b) the well-established role of serotonin in depressive disorders, and (c) the various 5-HT receptor subtypes that may be differentially stimulated following the facilitation of serotonergic transmission in the brain, the present study sought to investigate the involvement of the 5-HT system, particularly the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, in the antidepressant-like effect of adenosine in the FST.  Different neural structures may be involved in learning about different types of stimuli. The current study examines the effects of hippocampal, amygdala and perirhinal cortex lesions on recognition of changes in proximal objects, distal cues and the relationships among them. Evidence suggests that these structures are differentially involved in learning about stimulus relationships, distal stimulus identity and proximal object identity. Theories regarding the role of hippocampal function have implicated this structure in configural, conjunctive and declarative memory. While these theories have subtle differences regarding the nature of the representations that are maintained by the hippocampus, all theories have a common thread in postulating that the hippocampus is critical for learning about relationships among stimuli !!!REF!!!. An essential feature of this type of learning is that associations among multiple elements are combined to form a unique long-term memory representation !!!REFs!!!. Memory for spatial locations often requires relational memory, specifically when the subject uses cues to navigate to a goal from several different start locations !!!REFs!!!. However, some types of navigational tasks can be non-relational in nature, and remain intact after hippocampal lesions. For example, rats with fornix lesions show normal performance on the Morris water task if they are released from the same start location and required to swim to the same goal location each time. They are subsequently impaired relative to controls when starting from a novel location. Compared to controls, their behavior is abnormally dependent on the particular cues directly in front of them !!!REF!!!. This likely occurs because, without a relational representation, animals can only blend the distal cues, as viewed from one vantage point, into a unified representation. A relational representation is often composed of more than just spatial cues. For example, the simultaneous representation of discrete predictive cues and surrounding non-essential contextual information requires an intact hippocampus. Rats with hippocampal damage can learn a simple association between contextual cues and an aversive event, such as a shock. However, if a discrete stimulus is added that immediately precedes the aversive event, such as a tone, rats with hippocampal damage show fear responses to the tone, and not to the contextual cues !!!REFs!!!. Thus, rats with hippocampal damage over-focus on the stimulus most directly predictive of the event, and fail to acquire a relational representation including associations involving the surrounding cues. A similar phenomenon occurs with latent inhibition. Latent inhibition occurs when previous exposure to a stimulus results in slower acquisition of conditioned responses to that stimulus when it is paired with a positive or negative outcome. Hippocampal lesion rats show normal latent inhibition for discrete stimuli paired with reward. For example, pre-exposure to stimulus X leads to slower response acquisition rates for stimulus X compared to stimulus Y. However, hippocampal lesions lead to impaired latent inhibition for the stimuli surrounding the rewarded object. For example, following pre-exposure to stimulus X in context A rats with hippocampal lesions do not show normal reductions in response acquisition rates when trained in context A compared to context B !!!REF!!!. They also fail to show a normal disruption in responding to a rewarded stimulus when transferred to a different context !!!REF!!!. Again, these results suggest that the rats with hippocampal damage focus only on the cues that are most predictive of outcome, and fail to form a representation including the less-predictive surrounding cues. Taken together, the previous studies support the idea that rats with hippocampal damage lack a relational representation of the environment. Rather, they form a rigid association comprised of the stimulus/stimuli most immediately predictive of outcome. This representation likely excludes the relationships among the predictive stimulus/stimuli and the surrounding cues, the nature/identity of the surrounding cues and the relationship of the surrounding cues to each other. Thus, we anticipated that in a distraction paradigm rats with hippocampal damage would show impaired incidental learning about all cues surrounding those that immediately control their behavior. They were expected to be disrupted following changes to those essential cues, and not following changes in surrounding cues. The amygdala is important for associating objects or spatial relationships with positive or aversive outcomes in a passive classical conditioning setting !!!REFs!!!. However, it is unnecessary for remembering information about objects or spatial relationships !!!REFs!!!. There is evidence that amygdala lesions may lead to subtle deficits in spatial navigation due to an impaired ability to form a meaningful association between a specific location and its predicted valence !!!REF!!!. The amygdala also appears to mediate fear responses to novel stimuli or neophobia. Rats with amygdala lesions show attenuated neophobia for novel foods !!!REFs!!!. In a familiar open-field setting, amygdala damage leads to abnormal responding to a novel proximal object, but exploration of novel distal cues remains unaffected !!!REF!!!. This pattern of results may occur because the hippocampus can mediate responses to novel contextual information in the absence of an intact amygdala. In fact, the hippocampus and amygdala have competitive interactions for control of behavior. McDonald and White !!!REF!!! demonstrated that additional relational knowledge of the cues in the test room, acquired in a pre-exposure session, led to slower acquisition of a cue preference task in normal rats. Disruption of the hippocampal system eliminated competition between amygdala- and hippocampal-mediated strategies, and hence rate of task acquisition was enhanced in fornix lesion rats. Conversely, it is possible that animals with amygdala damage may focus more on context and stimulus relationships, rather than on individual proximal items. We expected that rats with amygdala damage would show normal incidental learning about relationships among cues, but may show impaired responding to individual novel proximal objects. We expected them to show normal disruption by the presence of novel stimulus relationships and novel contextual stimuli, as these behaviors may be mediated by the hippocampus. However, abnormal responses were anticipated in response to individual novel objects. The perirhinal cortex is important for perception and memory of object features and identity but not spatial arrangements !!!REFs!!!. However, perirhinal cortex lesions can lead to subtle deficits in memory for spatial locations. This may occur because perirhinal lesions impair processing of cue identity information, which normally makes a non-essential contribution to solving a task that requires the formation of relationships among these cues !!!REFs!!!. It appears that when object identity becomes more important for solving a spatial task the perirhinal cortex becomes more essential to performance (for review, see !!!REF!!!). The perirhinal cortex does not appear to be essential for relational memory !!!REF!!!, unless the only solution to a relational task requires simultaneous discrimination between several objects !!!REF!!!. We expected that rats with perirhinal cortex lesions would show normal incidental learning about relationships among cues. On the other hand, we expected them to show impaired disruption following changes to identity or form of stimuli. In the present study, rats were trained on a simple cover task. They were required to displace one object among five to obtain food reward. This is a goal-correlated task, as opposed to incidental, due to the explicit pairing of a specific behavioral response with a desired outcome. However, incidental learning about the non-rewarded cues can be measured using this paradigm. Once the rats acquired this task, different distal and proximal cues and relationships were manipulated as follows. The testing apparatus was rotated 90° relative to the distal cues in the room, and it was placed into a novel room with novel distal cues. These manipulations led to a change in the relationships between the proximal objects and the distal stimuli in the room. A familiar non-rewarded proximal object was replaced with a novel object, leading to a change in proximal stimulus relationships and non-essential object identity information. All of the objects were rearranged, including the target, which led to changes in relationships between the objects and with other proximal and distal stimuli. Object identity remained constant. All of the familiar objects, including the target, were replaced with novel ones, which led to a change in relationships between the objects and other proximal and distal stimuli, as well as changes in object identity information. The degree of disruption following each manipulation was recorded in terms of latency to displace the object, number of contacts with proximal objects prior to displacing the object, number of rears and number of errors. Disruption of task performance was taken as evidence that the animals detected novel stimuli or relationships. Increases in latency to displace the object were interpreted as the animals becoming distracted from the target object by salient changes in stimulus relationships or identity. Contacts with specific objects were interpreted as exploration of the proximal stimuli and rearing as exploration of distal stimuli, as in ref. !!!REF!!!. Increases in errors were interpreted as evidence that behavior was controlled by several sets of stimuli, such as the stimuli comprising the target object and stimuli surrounding the target object (contextual cues). This could only become apparent when the manipulations led to a novel conflict between previously compatible stimulus arrangements, such as rotation of the apparatus relative to the distal stimuli. Our hypotheses were as follows: (1) animals with hippocampal damage would show abnormal disruption following changes to all contextual stimuli surrounding those cues immediately controlling their behavior, and would be only disrupted following changes to essential stimuli. This means that they would show no change in task performance in response to the rotation, novel room or non-rewarded novel object. They would only be disrupted when all the objects, including the target, are rearranged or replaced. (2) Animals with amygdala damage would show normal disruptions in the presence of novel distal stimuli and distal relationships, but would show abnormal disruption in the presence of novel proximal objects. This means that they would show normal disruption in response to the rotation and novel room, and would show impaired disruption for a novel non-rewarded object, rearrangement of all objects and all novel objects. (3) Animals with perirhinal cortex damage would show normal disruption in the presence of novel distal stimuli and distal relationships, but would show abnormal disruption in the presence of novel proximal objects. This means that they would show normal disruptions following the rotation, and the novel room, and would show impaired disruption for a novel non-rewarded object, rearrangement of all objects and all novel objects.  Face perception is a highly developed visual skill in primates. Converging evidence from neuropsychology, neurophysiology, and cognitive development indicates that face perception may be mediated by a specialized neural system in the brain !!!REF!!!. In the past decade, with the advent of functional brain imaging techniques, it has been shown that face perception consistently activates a region in the lateral fusiform gyrus !!!REFs!!!. It has been proposed that the ‘fusiform face area’ is a module specialized for face perception !!!REF!!!. This region, however, also responds significantly to other categories of objects (e.g., houses, chairs, and tools), thus ruling out its status as a face “module” !!!REFs!!!. Furthermore, it has been shown that neural activation within the fusiform face-selective region is modulated by expertise !!!REFs!!!, attention !!!REF!!!, visual imagery !!!REFs!!!, and emotion !!!REF!!!. These findings suggest that the response to faces in extrastriate cortex is not the result of a mere hierarchical, bottom-up, ‘feature’ analysis, but is modulated by top-down effects, likely originating in parietal and frontal regions. The recognition of identity is based on invariant facial features, while changeable aspects of the face, such as speech-related movement and expression, contribute to social communication. When looking at faces, we automatically perceive the gender, expression, and mood. Processing the information gleaned from the faces of others therefore requires the integration of activation within a network of cortical regions. Numerous face perception studies have reported activation not only in the fusiform gyrus, but also in other regions in the visual cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex !!!REFs!!!. Haxby et al. have suggested that face perception is mediated by a distributed neural network in the human brain and have proposed a new model that includes a ‘core’ system and an ‘extended’ system !!!REF!!!. The core system is comprised of the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The ventral regions (IOG and FG) mediate the recognition of individuals. The more dorsal regions (STS) participate in the perception of social signals such as the direction of gaze, speech-related lip movements, and facial expressions !!!REFs!!!. The extended system includes the amygdala and the insula, which mediate the perception of emotional facial expressions, in particular fear, anger, and disgust !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, it has been shown that assessment of facial attractiveness evoked activation in prefrontal cortex !!!REF!!! and the reward circuitry, in particular the amygdala and nucleus accumbens !!!REF!!!. It is important to note, however, that not a single study has shown activation within all regions of both the core and the extended systems. The aim of this study was to test whether activation in regions of the distributed neural system associated with face perception could be localized with a simple task, namely passive viewing of various face stimuli. Previous studies focused on activation within the fusiform gyrus !!!REF!!!, or compared activation evoked by specific face stimuli, such as familiar versus unfamiliar faces !!!REF!!!. We adopted a more general approach, instructing subjects to view different face stimuli (line drawings of unfamiliar faces and photographs of unfamiliar, famous, and emotional faces) and analyzing all face-responsive regions in the brain. Our results indicate that viewing faces evokes activation in a distributed network that includes multiple, bilateral regions in the visual cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex. Within this network, the response to famous and emotional faces is stronger than the response to unfamiliar faces.  Methamphetamine (METH) is a synthetic drug and chemically related to amphetamine (AMPH) but has a higher potential for abuse. AMPH and related compounds mainly elicit impulse-independent release of monoamines from cytosolic stores by reversal of reuptake carrier activity !!!REF!!!. Continued use of psychostimulants is typically associated with the development of tolerance. However, repeated intermittent exposure to these psychostimulants such as AMPH, METH, and cocaine was found to produce behavioral sensitization, which is characterized by progressive and enduring augmentation of the behavioral effects in response to subsequent exposure to the same dose of the drug !!!REFs!!!. The potential clinical relevance of behavioral sensitization has been associated with development of craving in addicts and psychosis that arise from repeated exposure to these psychostimulants !!!REFs!!!. The most important characteristic of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants is long lasting, which persists for months even years after cessation of drug treatment !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, rearrangement and structural modification of neural networks and circuitry in the CNS must be involved in the development of behavioral sensitization. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the somatodendritic region of the mesolimbic dopamine neurons, whose nerve terminals project primarily to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), an important structure which has been described to mediate spontaneous and pharmacologically stimulated locomotor activity !!!REF!!!. The behavioral activating effects of AMPH are thought to depend primarily on its ability to increase dopamine release in the terminal regions of the mesoaccumbens and neostriatum !!!REF!!!. In addition, by regulating dopamine release in the midbrain, glutamate also plays an important role in regulation of motor activity !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the majority of studies related to behavioral sensitization were focused on dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. Neuroadaptations in the VTA and NAcc are now believed to be associated with the induction and expression of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants, respectively !!!REFs!!!. An abundance of neuroadaptive phenomena observed during the establishment of behavioral sensitization was occurring in a time-dependent fashion !!!REF!!!, and some of these alterations appear to be vanished at post-treatment periods !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, the expression of behavioral sensitization after short-term and long-term periods of abstinence may be dependent on different cellular mechanisms, and other neurotransmitter systems may be involved in and contribute to the expression of behavioral sensitization during the period of abstinence. Topographic overlaps between opioid and dopamine neurons were found in the VTA, substantia nigra, striatum, and limbic areas, suggesting that there are interactions between these two systems !!!REFs!!!. Acute administration of AMPH or METH is known to increase endogenous opioid contents !!!REF!!!, and mesolimbic structures such as VTA and NAcc receive β-endorphin containing fibers !!!REF!!!. Although opioid agonists had been known to increase the firing rate of dopamine neurons !!!REF!!! and increase dopamine levels !!!REF!!! in the VTA, the character of opioidergic system in chronic use of psychostimulants still remains unclear. Numerous studies strongly suggest the involvement of opioidergic system in some effects of AMPH or METH. For example, METH is more toxic in morphine-dependent mice than in normal mice (LD50: 20.6mg/kg versus 43.2mg/kg) !!!REF!!!. METH-induced conditioned place preference was found to be additively enhanced by co-administration with morphine !!!REF!!!, but inhibited by pretreatment with opioid receptor antagonist !!!REF!!!. In various laboratory animal species, specific opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was found to decrease both AMPH-induced locomotor activity and AMPH-induced increase in extracellular levels of dopamine !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, morphine given alone not merely increases locomotor activity, but cross-sensitizes the behavioral effects to direct dopamine agonist, apomorphine, and indirect dopamine agonist, AMPH or METH !!!REFs!!!. These findings provided us an interest to determine whether opioidergic system is involved in the chronic actions of METH. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the role of opioidergic system in METH-induced behavioral sensitization. This may lead not only to a better understanding of how this drug affects the behavior, but also to a better understanding of the underlying interactions between neurotransmitter systems.  Our clinical observations revealed distinctive phenomena in type 2 diabetic patients who began continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII) via insulin pump (Dana Diabecare II, Sooil, Korea). At the beginning of CSII therapy, most patients’ blood glucose levels normalized within 1–2 weeks during which they exhibited eating disorders, cortisol insufficiency and severe pain sensations characteristic of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The symptoms disappeared with daily treatments of 1mg dexamethasone (DEX) and 40mg tramadol, a centrally acting mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor. Two to three months later, omitting tramadol increased blood glucose levels by approximately 3.3–4.4mM without any reported change in pain sensation. Re-administration of tramadol made blood glucose levels return to normal without changing the insulin dosage in the patients (unpublished data). In other words, tramadol demonstrated hypoglycemic effects in type 2 diabetes patients. Ligands of the MOR, including morphine and β-endorphin, are known to have profound effects on peripheral metabolism such as blood pressure, heart rate and respiration !!!REF!!!. While some of these effects may be mediated by receptors located on peripheral tissues !!!REF!!! or vagal afferents !!!REF!!!, central opioid receptors are also important !!!REF!!!. Although MOR was widely distributed within the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues, specific region and content variation existed !!!REFs!!!. According to the detection techniques, MOR expression was reported to be varied. MOR was expressed mainly in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus within CNS, and in the small intestine, kidney, adrenal, heart and spleen within peripherals !!!REFs!!!. However, MOR was minimally expressed in hepatocytes. Tramadol, a 4-phenylpiperidine analogue of codeine, has been developed as an atypical centrally-acting opioid agent !!!REF!!!. It activates the opiatergic and the serotonergic systems in the CNS !!!REFs!!! to reduce peripheral pain. With its unique dual mechanisms of action, tramadol provides excellent analgesia, particularly in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain !!!REF!!!. Thus, tramadol works through the CNS to reach the peripherals. In contrast to other opioids, the analgesic action of tramadol is only partially inhibited by an MOR antagonist, naloxone, which suggests the existence of another mechanism of action. DEX mediates various metabolisms through the CNS and peripheries. One of them is glucose homeostasis. DEX has been known to induce hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance through the suppression of glucose utilization directly in liver and adipose tissues and indirectly via the CNS !!!REF!!!. Some studies have provided evidences that DEX influences brain glucose metabolism and indirectly modulates peripheral glucose metabolism in cell culture and animal studies !!!REFs!!!. Exposure of cortical astrocytes to DEX resulted in the reduction of noradrenaline-induced glycogen synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner !!!REF!!!. DEX increased peripheral insulin resistance in vivo, which was connected to the suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal glands (HPA) axis !!!REF!!!. In addition, DEX selectively suppressed the MOR and 5-HT receptors, especially the 5-HT1A receptor in the brain !!!REFs!!!. Thus, DEX was selected as a broad inhibitor of tramadol in this study, and naloxone was used as a specific inhibitor of MOR in order to determine whether tramadol can improve glucose homeostasis through MOR and/or 5-HT receptors. The long-term effect of tramadol on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling cascade was determined in the CNS and periphery of 90% pancreatectomized (Px) male Sprague–Dawley rats. The changes of peripheral glucose metabolism were examined by measuring insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion capacity. Px rats were a good model in which to study this effect since they have moderate symptoms of type 2 diabetes, especially Asian diabetes, a combination of insulin resistance and insulin insufficiency.  Motion sickness is very common in the population and especially in children !!!REF!!!. Despite this relatively high frequency its physiopathology remains largely unknown. Many theories !!!REFs!!! have been proposed and the most commonly accepted refer to a sensory conflict, notably visuo-vestibular. Nevertheless, these sensory conflict theories do not allow a complete understanding of motion sickness. In particular, they are unable to explain why some people are more prone than others to experience symptoms of motion sickness in provocative situations (e.g. in rough sea condition or in the rear seats of cars for children). The true nature of this particular susceptibility is completely unknown. Some symptoms of motion sickness are of an autonomic nature (i.e. pallor, cold sweating) but the hemodynamic modifications remain unclear. A decrease or increase in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported !!!REFs!!! but with a variable pattern in people experiencing motion sickness. Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope and its frequency is also high in children !!!REFs!!!. The role of the autonomic nervous system is better understood for vasovagal syncope than for motion sickness, and the hemodynamic modifications have been comprehensively characterised !!!REFs!!!. Once again however some aspects of the physiopathology remain unclear and the nature of the particular susceptibility of certain subjects to vasovagal syncope is completely unknown. The aim of our work was to study the relationship between motion sickness susceptibility (MSS) and vasovagal syncope susceptibility (VSS). We also evaluated the personal and familial characteristics concerning motion sickness and vasovagal syncope. To this end, young adults, were investigated by means of a questionnaire.   The metabolic complications of hyperglycemia and acidosis, both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, affects retina, kidney, muscle, blood vessels and the nervous system !!!REF!!!. Hyperglycemia and acidosis are the important elements, which lead to diabetic complications through multi-step process !!!REFs!!!. It has been shown that elevated glucose level, lactate production and intra-cerebral acidosis correlate with increased brain damage !!!REF!!!. Hyperglycemia induced by glucose activates tyrosine hydroxylase !!!REF!!! and it alters the turnover rate of dopamine !!!REF!!! in rat brain. Abnormal concentrations of extra-cellular neurotransmitters, which have been seen in diabetic patients correlate with increased CNS disorder and brain damage. We have recently shown that the levels of catecholamines altered in different brain regions of rats treated with glucose or NH4Cl (which mimics hyperglycemia or acidosis of spontaneous diabetes mellitus) and in alloxan diabetes !!!REFs!!!. These changes were reversed after insulin administration suggesting that, uncontrolled diabetes (alloxan) and/or associated hyperglycemia or acidosis per se could potentially lead to CNS disorder. Neurotransmitters and hormones are important organizers of the brain, especially during the development of neuro-endocrine systems !!!REFs!!!. The abnormal levels of which can alter the morphological and functional development permanently !!!REF!!!. Since hyperglycemia and acidosis are the most important factors that lead to diabetic complications, we investigated the effects of acute (7 days) glucose-induced-hyperglycemia and sodium acetoacetate or ammonium chloride induced acidosis on the level of indolamines in discrete areas of rat brain to find out the role of hyperglycemia or acidosis in the modulation of indolamines. The Ca2+-dependent protein kinases play a major role in cellular functions and have a wide tissue and sub-cellular distribution !!!REF!!!. We have recently identified that CaMKII, a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase altered during hyperglycemic and acidotic conditions, which is identical with the changes of indolamines in many brain regions. PKC-α, a classical Ca2+-dependent protein kinase that is sensitive to Ca2+, diacylglycerol (DAG) or phorbol esters plays major role in the regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and release !!!REFs!!!. Several other studies showed that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters increased the neurotransmitter release !!!REFs!!!. PKC altered the release of dopamine from mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal neurons by mediating signaling pathways !!!REF!!!. PKC also modulates 5-HT3A receptor function !!!REF!!! and serotonergic regulation of GABA transmission through a mechanism that is dependent on PKC !!!REF!!! suggesting that the PKC is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter functions either directly or indirectly. We have also shown recently !!!REF!!! that PKC-α expression correlated with the level of indolamines under diabetic conditions (30 days). However, the role of PKC-α on indolamines level under hyperglycemic or acidotic conditions are poorly understood. This study is of importance because the onset or severity of hyperglycemia is faster and/or more than that of acidosis so that studying indolamines under hyperglycemic and acidotic conditions either in acute (current study) or chronic conditions !!!REF!!! will explain whether the hyperglycemia or acidosis is the cause for the modulation of these amines. Therefore, we investigated the effect of glucose-induced-hyperglycemia and sodium acetoacetate or ammonium chloride induced acidosis on PKC-α expression/activity after 7 days and correlated with the changes of indolamines.  Internal body temperature is considered to be a limiting factor during prolonged physical exercise !!!REFs!!!. However, the mechanisms responsible for exercise fatigue related to increasing body temperature ( b) are still not fully understood, and it is not known whether the increase in temperature during exercise is due to a rise in set-point levels or whether it occurs passively through an unwanted accumulation of heat !!!REFs!!!. Controversy also exists regarding whether there is a critical absolute value of b and/or heat storage (HS) that determines the point of fatigue. Fuller et al. !!!REF!!! showed that rats exercising at high room temperatures reached fatigue at the same abdominal and brain temperatures (∼40°C) even after pre-exercise body temperature was altered. Their results are therefore consistent with the concept that high body core temperature reduces the CNS drive for exercise performance !!!REFs!!!, and with the hypothesis that hyperthermia precipitates feelings of fatigue at a sublethal threshold and establishes a safe guard against heat stroke, protecting the brain from thermal damage !!!REFs!!!. On the other hand, high body heat storage is also associated with the termination of work in animals !!!REF!!! and healthy humans !!!REFs!!!. Therefore, considering that fatigue is coincident or may be precipitated by high core temperature and/or heat storage, activation of a central mechanism that would increase heat loss and decrease core temperature might improve exercise performance. It has been demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) acting on the brain exerts thermoregulatory effects producing anapyrexia !!!REFs!!! and hypothermia !!!REFs!!!. l-Arginine (nitric oxide synthase—NOS substrate) analogues and NOS blockers such as ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) have been used to investigate the role of NO in body temperature under resting conditions !!!REFs!!!. Several studies have observed that intracerebroventricular injection of l-NAME causes a slight increase in the b of rats, indicating that central NO plays a tonic role in reducing b !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, in the case of fever induced by interleukins (IL-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or psychological stress, intracerebroventricular l-NAME enhanced stress fever, supporting the hypothesis that NO in the CNS leads to a reduction in b !!!REFs!!!. Since hypothermia and increased heat dissipation may be neuroprotective, activation of central oxide nitrergic transmission may exert important effects on thermoregulation during exercise, influencing running performance. It is important to emphasize that until now, there have been no reports in the literature relating brain nitric oxide and thermoregulation during exercise. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of the central administration of the NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME on heat balance and threshold b for tail vasodilation (TTbV) in untrained rats submitted to exercise until fatigue.  Damage or inflammation of deep craniofacial tissues such as the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or masticatory muscles are often considered important in the pathophysiology of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) !!!REF!!!. A number of studies have shown that jaw motor functions may be altered in TMD patients !!!REFs!!!. A possible reason for such alterations in jaw movements could be modification of craniofacial sensory transmission to jaw motoneurons, since the activity of jaw motoneurons greatly depends on sensory feedback from craniofacial structures !!!REF!!!. The jaw-opening reflex (JOR) is a trigeminal brainstem reflex that can be evoked by either nociceptive or non-nociceptive craniofacial stimulation (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). The shortest reflex arc involves only two synapses; primary afferents synapse on sensory relay neurons in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal brainstem complex, and these neurons project to and drive digastric motoneurons bilaterally !!!REF!!!. The JOR involves a transient excitation of the jaw-opening muscles and inhibition of the jaw-closing muscles (e.g., !!!REF!!!). Therefore, the JOR is useful for the assessment of sensorimotor processing in the trigeminal region !!!REFs!!!. Experimental models of deep craniofacial pain have reported that the inhibitory response of the jaw-closing muscles evoked by noxious stimulation to peri-oral tissues can be suppressed in the presence of masticatory muscle pain in man, and have suggested that the inhibition occurs at the premotoneuronal level !!!REFs!!!. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that the JOR evoked by noxious stimulation can be suppressed by activation of pain-modulatory systems in anesthetized animals, with a concomitant suppression of the sensory relay neurons (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). However, it is still not clear if the JOR evoked by low-intensity stimulation can be modulated by noxious conditioning stimulation of deep craniofacial tissues. Kurose et al. have recently shown that the injection of mustard oil (MO), an inflammatory irritant and small-fiber excitant, into the temporalis muscle can induce a significant suppression of the JOR evoked by low-threshold stimulation of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) !!!REF!!!. However, the effect of the MO injection was tested only for the reflex response evoked by stimulation of the IAN ipsilateral to the MO injection. Unlike spinal reflexes, stimulation on one side of the craniofacial region evokes synchronized JOR responses on both sides (e.g., !!!REFs!!!). Clarification of the effects of unilateral inflammation of deep craniofacial tissues could require testing of the effects of unilateral noxious craniofacial stimulation on the JOR evoked by stimulation of ipsilateral and contralateral IAN. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to test the effects of unilateral injection of MO into the rat TMJ region on the JOR evoked by low-threshold stimulation of the IAN both ipsilateral and contralateral to the MO injection.  Throughout adult life, neural progenitors in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) give rise to new neurons in the granule cell layer (GCL) !!!REFs!!!. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been described in several species, including rodents, non-human primates and humans !!!REFs!!!. Double labeling of the thymidine analogue 5′-bromo-2′ deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 at different time points after injection with BrdU showed that cell progenitors remain proliferating for approximately 4 days !!!REF!!!. After the cells become postmitotic, they differentiate into granule cells, send axons to the CA3 region !!!REF!!! and receive input from other cells !!!REF!!!. About 50% of the newly generated neurons die between 10 days and 1 month after their birth !!!REFs!!!. Interestingly, there is evidence that many of the newly formed cells can be rescued by training animals in a hippocampus-dependent learning task or housing them under enriched conditions !!!REFs!!!. However, it is still unknown which factors determine if a newly formed cell will survive and be integrated in the hippocampal circuitry. The present study was aimed at investigating whether the input from the medial septum (MS) into the hippocampus is involved in the regulation of newly formed cell survival and differentiation. The MS consists of cholinergic neurons as well as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing interneurons and projection neurons. The cholinergic neurons innervate the three major cell types of the hippocampus, i.e. the pyramidal, non-pyramidal and granule cells !!!REFs!!!, whereas GABAergic projection neurons mainly innervate hippocampal interneurons !!!REFs!!!. The septohippocampal pathway has been shown to be pivotal for proper hippocampal functioning. Memory performance can be correlated with cholinergic activity in the hippocampus, measured by high-affinity choline uptake or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, mechanical disruption of the septal projections to the hippocampus !!!REFs!!! or lesions of the MS !!!REFs!!! disturb memory retention. Considering the key role of the basal forebrain in cognitive functions, the learning-induced increase of adult neurogenesis !!!REFs!!! could potentially be caused by an increased activation of the septohippocampal pathway. Moreover, during aging a loss in MS cholinergic and GABAergic cells has been reported, which leads to an impairment in hippocampal functioning !!!REFs!!!. Concomitantly with the decrease of cell number in the MS, hippocampal neurogenesis significantly declines during aging !!!REFs!!!. Additional data also suggest a role for the MS in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Wheel running, for instance, which has been shown to evoke hippocampal theta waves induced by synchronized signaling of septal cholinergic and GABAergic neurons !!!REF!!!, robustly increases hippocampal neurogenesis in mice and rats !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, a recent study by Cooper-Kuhn et al. !!!REF!!! has shown that 192IgG-saporin infusion into the lateral ventricle, which causes cholinergic lesion of the basal forebrain including the MS, reduces hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, rats were injected with BrdU in order to gain a deeper insight into the role of MS-derived cholinergic and GABAergic projections to the hippocampus on the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Five days after the last BrdU injection, -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) was infused into the MS to induce an excitotoxic lesion. One week after the lesion, the impact of a reduced septohippocampal innervation on hippocampal neurogenesis was investigated using immunocytochemistry for BrdU and the proliferation marker Ki-67.  Glutamatergic pathways originating from the sensomotor cortex and the subthalamic nucleus are the major route of excitatory input to the corpus striatum. They play a crucial role in cognition and motor coordination and participate in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases !!!REF!!!. In these pathways, glutamate regulates its own release via stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are cationic-specific ion channels and mediate fast excitation. The -metyl-d-asparate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and kainate (KA) receptors have distinct characteristics of ion permeability, rectification and desensitization properties determined by their subunit composition !!!REF!!!. Mammals express six NMDA receptor subunits, four AMPA receptor subunits and five KA receptor subunits !!!REF!!!. KA, a pyrrolidine excitotoxin isolated from the seaweed is acting on glutamate receptors, which lead to neurotoxic damage resembling the alterations observed in some neurological disorders !!!REF!!!. Recent reports suggest that ionotropic glutamate receptors may have a unique transmembrane topology not shared by other ligand-gated ion channels. The ionotropic receptors opening a cationic channel that allows the passage of Na+, K+ and Ca2+. Neocortical AMPA and KA receptors show little permeability to Ca2+, except for a subpopulation of interneurons. The NMDA receptor, in addition to allowing the passage of Na+ and K+, is the major calcium ionophore of the cerebral cortex. This receptor differs from the other glutamate receptors by being both ligand-gated and voltage sensitive !!!REF!!!. Stimulation of glutamate KA receptors induces neuronal nitric oxide (NO) release, which in turn modulates glutamate transmission !!!REFs!!!. NO is a highly reactive signal molecule and plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous system. It is a unique messenger molecule that serves diverse physiological functions throughout the body. NO is synthesized from l-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The agent is a chemical messenger that acts on interneuronal communications, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, receptor function, intracellular signal transmission and mediator release !!!REFs!!!. The neural form of NOS (nNOS) is widely distributed in the nervous system and produces NO primarily in response to activation of NMDA receptors stimulated by glutamate !!!REF!!!. Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter of the brain. This neurotransmitter participates mainly in synaptic interactions, because glutamatergic release sites are located predominantly within synapses. Although some synaptic spillover of glutamate has been observed the diffusion of escaped glutamate is very limited because of the neuronal and glial uptake processes, therefore, under physiological conditions only a small portion of released glutamate leaves the synaptic cleft and may reach only glutamate receptors located perisynaptically or in neighboring synapses. In contrast, NO is highly diffusible gas that easily penetrates biological membranes. Although its half-life is only a few seconds, even during this short period it can diffuse a few hundred micrometers. Comparing this distance to the width of a synaptic cleft (20nm) or the size of a cell body (a few micrometers), it is evident that NO produced post-synaptically by nNOS may influence the function of a large number of neurons in a sphere around the synapse. Thus, via NO, glutamate may participate in long-range non-synaptic interactions. NO can be regarded as a non-synaptic extension of glutamate. Since the production of NO by nNOS synthase is closely related to the activation of NMDA receptors, the level of NO around synapses reflects the activity of glutamatergic neurotransmission !!!REF!!!. However, pathological conditions may occur when higher fluxes of these mediators are generated, such as during the process referred to as excitotoxicity, i.e. the excessive activation of glutamate KA receptors. This is a condition common to both acute and chronic neurological diseases !!!REFs!!!. Excitotoxicity produced by glutamate is initiated by a sustained increase of intracellular Ca2+. Influx of Ca2+ serves as a signal for activation of Ca2+-calmodulin dependent and protein kinase C regulated NOS. Activation of NOS generates NO, which can produce oxidative damage. In addition, elevated cytosolic free Ca2+ can activate phospholipase A2, leading to the subsequent generation of arachidonic acid. The metabolism of arachidonic acid, than can produce free reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation !!!REF!!!. Because NO is reactive free radical, it has many potential targets to initiate neurotoxic cascades. It is well known that NO toxicity may be amplified by the presence of superoxide radical, the one-electron reduction product of oxygen, since these species react at diffusion-limited rate to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant !!!REF!!!. Thus, oxidative stress plays a critical role in excitotoxicity !!!REF!!!. The literature results implicate neuronal NO generation in the pathogenesis of both direct and secondary excitotoxic neuronal injuries in vivo. The precise cellular mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity under these conditions still remain unclear. Although NMDA receptors likely contribute critically to neuronal injury in various acute conditions, several observations support the hypothesis that AMPA/KA receptors may be of greater importance to the neurodegenerative process !!!REFs!!!. Considerable evidence supports a link between Ca2+ influx and glutamate receptor-mediated neurodegeneration. Brief periods of activation of highly Ca2+-permeable NMDA channels can result in substantial intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and widespread neuronal injury !!!REFs!!!. Mitochondria can buffer these large Ca2+ loads but they do so at the expense of triggering injurious ROS production !!!REF!!!. Additionally, the extremely rapid interconversion of ROS within the cell can make it difficult to identify the originating species. It was, also, reported differential role of NMDA and AMPA/KA receptors in superoxide production and mitochondrial MnSOD activity in the rat brain !!!REF!!!. It is considered that ATP depletion in brain is mediated by activation of NMDA receptors. At least three mechanisms contribute to this effect: (a) activation of the Ca2+-calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates Na/K-ATPase, increasing its activity and the consumption of ATP. (b) Increases intracellular Ca2+, mostly taken up by mitochondria leading to impair the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. (c) Increased Ca2+ activates NOS and the formation of NO that impairs the function of some hem-containing components of the respiratory chain and decreases ATP synthesis !!!REF!!!. In view of the above, the present study was undertaken to examine whether the production of NO after receiving intracerebral KA injections can be modulated with pretreatment with competitive glutamate receptor antagonists: CNQX, selective AMPA/KA receptor antagonist and APV, selective NMDA receptor antagonist.  Many investigations demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of volatile anesthetics as a result of antagonizing release of neurotransmitters in central nervous system after cytotoxic insult !!!REFs!!!. In the striatum, exaggerated dopamine (DA) release and subsequent DA metabolism induces neurotoxic effect, including neural death. Previously, we reported that halothane anesthesia itself increased the extracellular concentration of DA and its metabolites using in vivo microdialysis technique in the rat striatum !!!REF!!!. Opacka-Juffry et al. !!!REF!!! demonstrated that nomifensine-induced increase in extracellular striatal DA is enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. In an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia, the antagonizing effect on increasing DA concentration with volatile anesthetics was unclear !!!REF!!!, whereas the ability of the anesthetics to reduce neuronal damage is well known !!!REFs!!!. Although the exact mechanism of anesthesia is still unclear, it is possible that volatile anesthetics modulate DA homeostasis including release and metabolism !!!REF!!!. We hypothesized that the effect of anesthetics on DA release and metabolism might be dependent on the modification of DA regulation before induction of anesthesia. In another study, halothane attenuated haloperidol- and enhanced clozapine-induced DA release in the rat striatum !!!REF!!!. The biphasic effect of halothane might be explained by the non-synaptic neural transmission of striatal interneurons. However, there are scarce investigation for the effect of volatile anesthesia on DA release and metabolism modified by pharmacological treatments in advance to the inhalation of anesthesia. Ischemia-induced DA release has been extensively studied !!!REF!!! and the certain neuroprotective effect of volatile anesthetics was reported !!!REF!!!. In the current investigation, we studied the effect of isoflurane anesthesia on pargyline (monoamine oxidase inhibitor)-induced DA increase using in vivo microdialysis techniques in the rat striatum.  Severe instabilities in plasma estrogen levels in women, occurring postpartum and during the beginning of the perimenopauzal period are typically associated with an increased risk of the emergence of depressive symptoms and anxiety !!!REFs!!!. Several studies, although not all, have reported a reduction of the depressive symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women during treatment with estrogen, estrogen-like compounds or estrogen combined with progesterone !!!REFs!!!. In addition, estrogen replacement effectively augmented the effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in women suffering from therapy resistant major depression !!!REF!!!. Ovariectomized female rats treated with estrogen display a decrease in anxiety related behavior in repeated open field exposure and reduced immobility in the forced swim test !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, female rats in proestrus, when the plasma estrogen levels are high, spent more time in the open arms of a plus maze than rats in diestrus !!!REF!!!. The anxiolytic effects of estradiol are specifically attributed to estrogen receptor β (ERβ) !!!REFs!!!. Together, these findings show that estrogen is involved in the modulation of mood and emotion. Estrogen actions are mediated by interactions with nuclear estrogen receptors (ER), these complexes can bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) that are present in the promoter region of target genes which subsequently modulate gene transcription !!!REFs!!!. ERs, appearing as the nuclear ERα and ERβ subtype, are widely expressed in brain areas involved in processing emotional stimuli, for example, in the amygdala, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, the frontal cortex and the raphe nuclei of both human and rats !!!REFs!!!. Epidemiological studies show that stressful life experiences are associated with the onset of affective disorders, like major depression and anxiety disorders !!!REFs!!!. It has been reported by our group and by others that brain activity in the limbic system and hippocampal areas of rats is affected by chronic stress exposure !!!REFs!!!. Accordingly, chronic stress exposure is used as an animal model for studying the development and treatment of affective disorders. Estrogen modulates the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, the primary neuroendocrine stress response !!!REFs!!!. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is an important relay nucleus in the HPA-axis and, in rodents, mainly expresses ERβ !!!REFs!!!. The occurrence of ERβ in the PVN might serve as an important link in the interaction between estrogen and stress reactivity. Likewise, critical influences of ERβ on the HPA-axis response to stress have been reported !!!REF!!!. In the current study, we investigated how several components of the HPA system of ovariectomized female rats that were treated with estradiol (the most common naturally occurring estrogen) respond to stress compared to ovariectomized rats treated with vehicle. We studied the effects of acute and chronic stress and estradiol treatment on the plasma corticosterone response, ERβ expression and PVN activation. We hypothesized that estradiol-treated rats exhibit more controlled responses to stress than the ovariectomized vehicle-treated rats. Most studies investigating the effects of estrogen treatment in the central nervous system employed estradiol-releasing pellets or daily injection schemes resulting in invariable, often supraphysiological, plasma estradiol levels. Such invariable levels are likely to induce ER downregulation limiting the possibility for estradiol to interact with its receptor, and consequently reducing the binding of ER-estradiol complexes to EREs, which can lead to educed effects of estradiol in the brain. In our view, cyclic availability of estradiol is highly relevant for a system that is designed to react to alternating high and low levels of estradiol. Natural changes in the plasma estradiol levels may be important for the supportive effects in the regulation of the emotional system. Throughout the estrous cycle, the ratio in plasma gonadal hormones changes daily. We have never observed synchronization of the estrus cycle in previous experiments with cyclic female rats, and moreover some studies claim an effect of stress on the plasma estradiol concentration throughout the cycle !!!REFs!!!. To ensure identical estradiol levels in each estradiol-treated rat in the current study we introduced an artificial estradiol cycle. We used a cyclic injection scheme of estradiol administration (every fourth day, comparable to the rat estrus cycle) that produces plasma levels that are within the physiological range, to explore the effects of stress exposure in rats with alternating high and low plasma estradiol levels compared to ovariectomized rats.  Numerous data indicate that the brain represents a target tissue for Vitamin D actions !!!REFs!!!. This steroid hormone plays an important role in the nervous system including differentiation, regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, modulation of neurotrophins release and activity of key brain genes and enzymes of neurotransmitter metabolism !!!REFs!!!. The functions of Vitamin D are mediated through the nuclear Vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptors superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors !!!REFs!!!. VDR are widespread in the brain and the spinal cord, implying the potential role of both Vitamin D and VDR in the brain !!!REFs!!!. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-D, calcitriol) is the main biologically active metabolite of Vitamin D and the principal ligand for VDR, exerting its effects in a manner similar to other steroid hormones !!!REFs!!!. There are several lines of evidence that link various Vitamin D-related disorders to epilepsy. Low Vitamin D leads to hypocalcemia able to induce seizures due to hyperexcitability of the neural membranes !!!REFs!!!. In humans, seizures accompanied by hypocalcemia and lowered Vitamin D levels are often seen in patients with hereditary or nutritional rickets !!!REFs!!!. In line with this, Vitamin D and calcium therapy have long been known to reduce seizures by relieving hypocalcemia in such patients !!!REFs!!!. Taken together, this allowed to discuss the possibility of anticonvulsant action of Vitamin D !!!REF!!!, possibly due to its positive effects on mineral and hormonal homeostasis. At the same time, it has long been known that chronic treatment with antiepileptic drugs impairs mineral homeostasis in epileptic patients, leading to a marked hypocalcemia and reduced plasma levels of Vitamin D (which in turn may increase seizure) !!!REFs!!!. These observations have led to a wide practice of using Vitamin D as an additional therapy in epilepsy !!!REFs!!!. However, there is mounting evidence indicating that Vitamin D per se may play a significant role in the physiological mechanisms underlying various brain disorders. For example, Vitamin D dysfunctions have recently been suggested to play a role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression, rev.: !!!REFs!!!. As a physiologically active neurosteroid hormone, Vitamin D is also involved in multiple neuroprotective mechanisms (rev. in !!!REFs!!!). Can the Vitamin D system be involved in epilepsy? In addition to clinical findings described earlier, there are some animal data that directly support this notion !!!REFs!!!. In their pioneering study, Siegel et al. !!!REF!!! reported direct anticonvulsant effects (increased seizure threshold in rats following the electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus) within 5–10min after i.c.v. or i.v. injection of 1,25-D. Thus, the potential role of Vitamin D in epilepsy, and the possibility of direct anticonvulsant properties of this neurosteroid hormone, seem to justify further experimental investigation. In the present study, we examined the effects of 1,25-D administration on chemically induced seizures in mice. Since pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a potent blocker of the chloride ionophore at the gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA-A receptors, is the most frequently used chemoconvulsant in experimental models of epilepsy !!!REFs!!!, we used this model in our experiments. Given a relatively high toxicity of 1,25-D due to its well-known hypercalcemic effects, we used 33μg/20μl of the drug in the present study, basing our choice on the earlier data !!!REF!!! using systemic doses and injection into the brain of 50–100μg of this drug in rats. Choosing the pre-treatment time for our studies, we considered earlier findings that 1,25-D may exert its anticonvulsant effects within 30–180min in the electroconvulsive model of seizures in rats !!!REF!!!. Here, we demonstrate that 1,25-D leads to reduced severity of seizures and lower mortality in the model of PTZ-induced seizures in mice.  Studies in rat hippocampal astrocytes !!!REF!!! or salamander photoreceptors !!!REF!!! demonstrate a Cl−-dependent reduction of outwardly rectifying voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents. The reduction of Kv current in astrocytes was a result of Cl− efflux following GABAA receptor activation !!!REF!!!. This phenomena is not merely restricted to potassium channels however. In salamander photoreceptors, activity-dependent [Cl−] changes have been shown to reduce voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity which leads to reduced synaptic transmission at the first retinal synapse !!!REF!!!. Further studies in photoreceptors also demonstrated effects of [Cl−] on Kv channels !!!REF!!!. These Cl−-dependent effects were found to be consistent with the anions’ lyotropic or Hofmeister physical characteristics that are based on charge density and associated water of hydration relating to ease of anion approach to the protein–water interface. Thus, it was proposed that Cl− may be screening charges on the protein structure leading to alterations in the field potential across the voltage sensor. An alternate explanation is that [Cl−] may indirectly affect gating by affecting the cytoplasmic domains of the channel. Voltage-gated potassium channels are formed when four alpha subunits assemble to form a pore in a membrane dependent on an ∼120 amino acid cytosolic N-terminal domain, termed the tetramerization domain (T1). The T1 N-terminal domain hangs like a gondola directly below the channel !!!REFs!!! and is highly conserved among the Kv1.–Kv4. α-subunits. What is interesting about this functional protein interaction domain is that in contrast to most assembly domain interfaces !!!REF!!!, this subunit interface is highly polar in nature, making the interaction much less stable. Mutagenesis studies addressing T1 complex stability and conformation showed that a conformational shift in the T1 tetramer is coupled to channel gating mechanisms !!!REFs!!!. Because salts (anions in particular) play a large role in protein folding and conformation !!!REFs!!!, it may be that [Cl−] is linked to Kv channel gating via the ability to affect the T1 tetramer conformational stability. To address this possibility, the effects of [Cl−] on individual Kv channel gating are assessed more closely using the isolated HEK293 cell expression system.  Huntington's disease (HD) is a chronic progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a striatal-specific degeneration !!!REF!!!. The pathological changes manifest clinically in midlife as a triad of cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbance and impairment of motor function. Several attempts have been made to develop experimental model of HD. In the most widely used animal models of HD, excitotoxic amino acids, such as kainic, quinolinic and ibotenic acids, are stereotactically injected into specific region of the brain. Besides being difficult, there is always a chance of error to inject the drugs into the target cells. The most recent model of HD is based on systemic injections of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a mitochondrial toxin that causes striatal neuropathy similar to that seen in clinical HD !!!REFs!!!. A major advantage of 3-NP model over other model of HD is that the lesions produced are bilateral, striatal specific and develop spontaneously after systemic administration of 3-NP. In spite of extensive research this devastating hereditary disease remains incurable, warranting further studies to determine the causes and cure of HD. The natural alkaloid nicotine present in Nicotiana tabacum is by far the most widely studied substance that originates from tobacco smoke and exhibits widespread pharmacological effects. During the last decade, there has been a rapid explosion of publications reporting the neuroprotective activity of nicotine. Recent studies clearly suggest that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the CNS is a new potential therapeutic target for the management of neurodegenerative diseases !!!REF!!!. O’Neill et al. !!!REF!!! have suggested that neuronal nAChRs agonists could provide motor improvement and retard the progressive course of various diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinsonism. Furthermore, nicotine has been shown to protect various neurons against a variety of neurotoxins via neuronal nAChRs in vivo !!!REFs!!! as well as in vitro !!!REFs!!!. In the present study, we demonstrate the protective effects of nicotine (0.25–1mg/kg) against 3-NP-induced behavioral, biochemical and histological changes in a rat model of HD.  The brain angiotensin system plays an important role in the central control of blood pressure !!!REFs!!!. While abnormal activity or expression of this system in the brain is suggested to be associated with the development and maintenance of hypertension !!!REFs!!!, the precise mechanisms concerning roles of brain angiotensins in hypertension are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that microinjection of angiotensin II into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) caused pressor responses in conscious rats !!!REFs!!!. In addition, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that there are angiotensin II-sensitive neurons in the AHA and that these neurons are tonically activated by endogenous angiotensins !!!REFs!!!. Acetylcholine in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PHN) has been also implicated in hypertension in SHR !!!REF!!!. Microinjection of the cholinergic agonists carbachol and physostigmine into the PHN elicits reproducible increases in blood pressure, which are abolished by prior microinjection of the cholinergic antagonist atropine !!!REF!!!. Microinjection of hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), a depleter of neuronal acetylcholine store, into the PHN decreases blood pressure in SHR !!!REF!!!. Furthermore, in SHR, muscarinic receptor binding is enhanced in the PHN !!!REF!!!, and injection of the cholinergic neurotoxin AF64A into the PHN causes a small but significant reduction in blood pressure several weeks after injection !!!REF!!!. There exist neuronal connections between the AHA and the PHN !!!REFs!!!. To examine whether neurons with cholinergic receptors in the PHN are involved in activation of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons in the AHA, we determined whether microinjection of cholinergic agonists into the PHN causes an increase in the firing rate of angiotensin II-sensitive neurons in the AHA of rats. For comparison, we also examined effects of PHN microinjection of the excitatory amino acid glutamate on the neural activity of AHA angiotensin II-sensitive neurons.  Spinal spasticity is often caused by spinal cord injury or multiple spinal scleroses and is associated with serious neuropathic pain !!!REFs!!!. Our understanding of this debilitating syndrome is very limited because of lacking an easily manipulated animal model, which restricted the effective drug discovery. Although several classes of compounds, including baclofen and tizanidine, showed some efficacy against spasticity, they were not appropriate for regular application because of the requirement of intrathecal administration and the side effects manifested after the long-term usage !!!REFs!!!. Recently, electrical stimulation has been widely accepted due to its efficacy, safety and technical simplicity !!!REFs!!!. Studies showed that high frequency electrical stimulation is more effective than low frequency !!!REFs!!!, though the underlying mechanism is not determined. We postulated that it might be related to the acceleration of the release of the spinal dynorphin A (1–17), a major factor in mediating electroacupuncture analgesia at high frequency !!!REFs!!!. Additionally, intrathecal (i.t.) administration of NDAP, an analogue of dynorphin A (1–8), has been found to successfully relieve spasticity in rabbit model !!!REF!!!. In the present study, we established a spinal spasticity model in the rat, and then measured immunoreactivity (IR) of spinal dynorphin A (1–17) during the induction of the spasticity in order to further explore the substantial roles that dynorphin A might play in the spinal spasticity.  Fluoxetine is a widely used antidepressant compound, its primary action is based on inhibition of serotonin-reuptake in the central nervous system. Numerous data indicate, however, that fluoxetine has some additional pharmacological effects as well !!!REF!!!. Several clinical observations and animal studies showed that fluoxetine enhanced the anticonvulsant potency of various antiepileptic drugs !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, fluoxetine exerted a franc anticonvulsant action in different models of epilepsy !!!REFs!!!. The anticonvulsant effect of fluoxetine was recently confirmed by our previous data yielded in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure model !!!REF!!!. Recent studies indicate, however, that fluoxetine has several additional effects on neuronal !!!REFs!!!, cardiac !!!REF!!!, smooth muscle !!!REF!!!, and epithelial !!!REF!!! cells. These effects appear to involve direct inhibition of various ion channels in the cell membrane. Reports studying the role of ion channels in the pathogenesis of epilepsy indicated that some conventional antiepileptic drugs inhibited Ca2+ channels !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, Ca2+ channel blockers were also claimed to reduce epileptiform activity !!!REFs!!!. It is generally believed that a significant part of the therapeutic activity of fluoxetine is attributable to its most important active metabolite norfluoxetine !!!REF!!!, which is produced via demethylation of fluoxetine by cytochrome P450-2C9 enzyme !!!REFs!!!. In contrast to the anticonvulsant and the well-characterized cellular electrophysiological actions of fluoxetine in neural membranes, little is known about these effects of norfluoxetine. The goal of the present study was, therefore, to compare the anticonvulsant effects of norfluoxetine and fluoxetine with those of clonazepam and phenytoin as well as to characterize the effect of norfluoxetine on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current of isolated rat cochlear neurons.  Sham or placebo surgery has been introduced in an attempt to elevate the methodological standards for evaluating surgical procedures to a level comparable to that of pharmacological trials. Unlike the inert placebos used in pharmacological trials, sham operations involve cutting into the human body and the administration of active drugs such as antibiotics and anaesthetics. As a consequence, a series of moral and ethical concerns have been raised, including the use of deception, the violation of the doctor-patient relationship and a deep seated cultural ‘distaste’ for conducting surgery for reasons other than essential treatment !!!REFs!!!. The ethical justification for sham surgery is based on a utilitarian argument that the long term scientific and clinical benefits of methodologically rigorous surgical trials can be balanced against the risks to individual participants !!!REF!!!. Sham surgery enables the implementation of double-blind, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) which are seen as ‘… the most effective way to control the placebo effect and the investigator bias’ (p. 989) !!!REF!!!. The methodological benefits for double-blinded trials are well known !!!REF!!! but it must be noted that these are hypothetical rather than factual benefits. Although the use of placebo control groups is a well established means of controlling for systematic error, it needs to be demonstrated that the placebo controls actually influence scientific and clinical decisions in defined areas of health research. For example, Hrobjartsson and Goetzsche !!!REFs!!! compared the differences in the degree of recovery between ‘placebo’ and ‘no treatment’ control groups as reported in 114 published RCTs. With the exception of ‘pain’, where there was a very modest difference, there were no statistically or clinically significant differences in outcome between the control groups. Hrobjartsson and Goetzsche pointed out that the evidence challenged the hypothesis that placebo treatments have powerful effects. No surgical placebo controlled trials were included in the above !!!REFs!!! meta-analysis. We contend that current risk-benefit assessments !!!REFs!!! had over-estimated the methodological benefits of placebo surgery by misinterpreting the results of recent double blind RCTs. Our aim is to conduct a detailed analysis of the evidence presented in four recent placebo controlled surgical trials to answer the following research questions: Does current evidence indicate strong and stable placebo effects following surgical procedures? Were results of sham-operated groups necessary for detecting useless and harmful surgical procedures? Are placebo-controlled RCTs the best designs available to ensure the protection of the public from ineffectual surgery? We are aware that the detailed methodological and statistical analyses constituting this paper make for rather tedious reading. However, there is a close and mutually constructive relationship between health research methodology and ethics. The facts which inform utilitarian ethical decisions are embedded within the tables, graphs and statistics of research publications. A consensual and methodologically principled assessment of the evidence is required in order to identify the factual benefits for using placebo surgery.  Activity and exercise, both forced and voluntary, increase the function of dopaminergic systems in the striatum !!!REFs!!!. Other central catecholaminergic systems, including norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi), are also influenced by exercise !!!REFs!!!. Norepinephrine concentrations in the pontine–medullary region, where central catecholamines are synthesized, are increased both by voluntary activity wheel exercise and forced treadmill activity in rats, with a concomitant increase in the NE/Epi catabolite MHPG in terminal regions such as the frontal cortex and hippocampus of treadmill trained rats !!!REF!!!. The relationship between activity and stress is complicated by the fact that exercise, especially forced physical activity, can be stressful in itself !!!REFs!!!, but exercise can also ameliorate the effects of other stressors !!!REFs!!!. Plasma glucocorticoid levels rise for 25min (females) to 40min (males) during forced exercise in mice !!!REF!!!. However, in rats, exercise training reduces the response of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) to acute exercise at the level of corticotropin (ACTH) in the pituitary !!!REF!!!, and increased NE concentrations in the hypothalamus !!!REF!!!. Non-exercise stressors, such as restraint or aggression, have also been demonstrated to elicit significant responses from central catecholaminergic systems !!!REFs!!!. Combined, these data suggest an interaction between or shared use of the pathways of the central catecholaminergic neural regulatory systems for stress and locomotor activity. Support for this comes from the observation that similar responses of central catecholamines are seen with physical activity and restraint stress !!!REF!!!. Additionally, central catecholamine levels modulate serotonergic activity in the raphé !!!REFs!!!, which plays a role in the neuroendocrine response to both physical and restraint stress !!!REF!!!. In the lizard , a similar co-regulation between stress and locomotor neurocircuitry influences central serotonergic activity !!!REF!!!. While forced physical activity increased serotonergic activity in the raphé, evidence that forced activity ameliorated restraint stress-induced elevation of serotonergic activity was seen in subiculum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, and area postrema. The neurotransmitter systems that mediate both motor activity and stress responsiveness are coordinated !!!REF!!!, and need to be for two reasons: regulation of glucocorticoid secretion to manage both energetic needs and stress reactions, plus acquisition of contextual significance to the interaction between locomotion and stress. For example, forced exercise that results from fleeing a predator should be stressful early, but should also help to ameliorate the stress response as the threat is diminished. We have hypothesized that rapid neural and endocrine responses correlate with the ability of an individual to cope with stress !!!REFs!!!, and currently extend this hypothesis to include physical stress, as measured by running. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the effects of forced physical activity and restraint stress on the central catecholaminergic systems in the lizard . We examined concentrations of dopamine (DA), NE and Epi in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, raphé, locus ceruleus, and area postrema; as monoaminergic activity in these nuclei are known to respond to stress and or exercise !!!REF!!!. We hypothesized that stress and physical activity interact via evoked monoaminergic responses within specific brain regions that are elements in an overlapping neurocircuitry.  Thyroid hormones (TH) are important for vertebrate growth and development in general and critical for brain development and maturation in particular. The thyroid gland mainly secretes the relatively inactive thyroxine (T4), which has to be deiodinated in the outer ring to receptor-active 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) to exert its full biological function. Three types of deiodinating enzymes have been characterized, type I, type II and type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D1, D2 and D3). While D1 has the ability to both activate and inactivate T4, D2 and D3, respectively, only produce and break down this TH. The impact of thyroid hormones on the development of the central nervous system is shown in situations of clinical or induced thyroid hormone excess or deficit. Especially processes of cell migration and formation of cortical layers are affected as well as neuronal and glial cell differentiation !!!REF!!!. The expression pattern of the deiodinases has been examined at the RNA level by in situ hybridization studies and northern blot analyses at well-defined time points. Based on the data coming from in situ hybridization studies, it was believed that the deiodinase mRNAs, in contrast to the thyroid hormone receptors, were expressed in non-neuronal cells, like astrocytes !!!REFs!!!. The astrocytes would then deliver the bioactive T3 to the neurons if needed. Recent studies investigating the deiodinase protein expression by means of antisera, however, altered this early hypothesis. Our group published the expression of D3 in the Purkinje cells of the chicken cerebellum, the first proof of the presence of a deiodinase protein in neurons !!!REF!!!. Two years later, the use of a chicken D1 antiserum showed the presence of D1 in the granule cells of the cerebellum !!!REF!!!. The expression of the different types of deiodinases in both neurons (D1/D3) and astroglial cells (D2) implies that a well-tuned communication mechanism must exist between these cell types. This explains why it is so important to completely map the expression of the different deiodinase proteins in different brain areas at well-defined developmental stages. Therefore, the main objective of the current study was to compare the distribution pattern of the three deiodinases in chicken cerebellum at two important developmental stages, namely at day 18 of embryonic development (E18) and 1 day after hatching (C1). At E18, the differentiation and migration of the different cerebellar cells is in full progress, whereas a 1-day-old chick already possesses a rather mature cerebellum with only the formation of some cell–cell communicative pathways to be established. Although other factors like for instance the external supply of bioactive TH should be kept in mind !!!REF!!!, making this comparison made it possible to postulate on how the neurons communicate with their support cells in order to obtain the exact amount of T3 necessary for the expression of different thyroid hormone responsive genes, like reelin, disabled protein 1 (dab1) and tenascin-C (tn-c). Both reelin and dab1 protein are involved in cell migration and are indispensable for correct lamination of the brain in general !!!REFs!!!. Reelin acts on neurons by binding to a lipoprotein receptor thus inducing the phosphorylation of dab1 protein, which in turn acts on neurons too, via a mechanism still unknown !!!REFs!!!. Tenascin-C on the other hand is required for cell adhesion purposes and to regulate dendritic outgrow !!!REF!!!. The expression of these three proteins was therefore also studied at E18 and C1 to be able to link the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the activating and inactivating deiodinase proteins during chicken ontogeny with the presence of these TH-responsive gene products. In addition, for dab1 the report on its ontogenetic distribution pattern in cerebellum is to our knowledge the first for non-mammalian vertebrates (!!!REF!!! ).  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system. The disease typically initiates as a relapsing–remitting phase followed by a transition to a secondary progressive disease type with more severe functional deficit !!!REF!!!. Animal models of this disease have been developed to study MS at controlled conditions. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established in the 1930s by intramuscular injections of rabbit brain emulsions !!!REF!!! and has thereafter been adapted for several rodent species. The most commonly studied form of EAE is an acute T-cell-mediated disease, which displays little or no demyelination. A chronic relapsing–remitting subtype of the disease with subsequent demyelination can, however, be induced !!!REFs!!!. The myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is located in the myelin sheaths encapsulating the neuron and is a strong encephalitogen. By immunizing the animals with purified MOG or recombinant peptides derived from the protein, a chronic relapsing–remitting disease type can be induced !!!REFs!!!. The neurofilaments constitute an important structural group of neuronal cytoskeleton proteins !!!REF!!! and have been shown to be reliable markers of neuronal degeneration and disease !!!REFs!!!. Patients with MS display significantly elevated levels of neurofilament light (NF-L) early in the disease progression !!!REFs!!!. We have recently developed a sensitive ELISA assay for measurement of NF-L levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) !!!REFs!!! and our aim was to investigate if MOG-induced EAE causes neuronal breakdown and release of neurofilaments into the CSF. Dark Agouti rats were immunized by recombinant rat MOG (aa 1–125) and the disease development was monitored and scored. After approximately 1 month the animals were sacrificed and the spinal cords and CSF, obtained by autopsies and cisterna magna puncture were analyzed for NF-L levels.  Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is characterised by brief frontal lobe motor seizures mostly occurring during non-rapid eye motion (non-REM) sleep. Affected individuals may awake with a non-specific aura before a motor seizure with tonic or hyperkinetic features. The retained awareness, commonly observed in ADNFLE patients is frequently misdiagnosed as parasomnias, night terror or hysteria !!!REF!!!. However, the use of video-polysomnography, combined with a careful analysis of clinical features, allows for a correct diagnosis of this syndrome !!!REF!!!. ADNFLE is clinically distinctive and relatively homogeneous, even though considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in seizure severity can be observed. The age of onset ranges from infancy to adulthood; however, about 80% of individuals are symptomatic in the first 2 decades of life, 10 being the mean age of onset !!!REFs!!!. Pedigree analysis revealed that ADNFLE transmission pattern is compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance (ranging from 29 to 100%) !!!REF!!!. Three loci, ENFL1 (MIM#600513), ENFL2 (MIM*603204) and ENFL3 (MIM#605375) have been associated to this syndrome. ENFL1, historically the first identified locus, maps on chromosome 20q13.2-13.3 and four different mutations in the CHRNA4 gene, coding for the alpha4 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), were found in eight unrelated families with different ethnic background !!!REF!!!. As far as the ENFL2 locus is concerned, it was assigned in a single family to chromosome 15q24 !!!REF!!!, but neither the gene nor the underlying mutation have been identified. The ENFL3 locus is located on chromosome 1q21 and two different mutations affecting the same codon of the CHRNB2 gene, coding for the beta2 subunit of the nAChR, have been reported in three unrelated families !!!REF!!!. In vitro functional analyses of all identified mutations have been performed showing a great variety of effects but sharing an increase of acetylcholine sensitivity. Moreover, no phenotype–genotype correlations could be established. The above reported mutations in CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 genes associated with ADNFLE have been found only in a minority of affected families (less than 12%) !!!REF!!!. In the remaining 88% of families with a well-defined clinical and video-polysomnographical diagnosis of ADNFLE, the involvement of the three above reported nAChR loci has not been found either by linkage or by mutational analysis, suggesting the existence of additional gene/s associated to ADNFLE !!!REFs!!!. Moreover, our group recently excluded linkage between this epileptic phenotype and all known brain-expressed nAChR subunit genes (CHRNA2–7, CHRNB2–4) in four unrelated Italian ADNFLE families !!!REF!!!, suggesting that the additional ADNFLE gene/s does/do not belong to the nAChR gene family. Several characteristics of ADNFLE cannot be completely explained by only considering it as a simple monogenic disease: the impossibility to draw a phenotype–genotype correlation, the variability of symptoms observed even among individuals of the same family and with the same genetic defect, the rarity of the identified mutations, the difficulty in linking the phenotype to the mutated receptor properties and the presence of several loci (three already known and at least one new locus not belonging to the nAChR subunit gene families): all these points are typical attributes of a complex disease (in the meaning of a disease in which the primacy of any individual gene is not perceptible but it is caused by the interactions of two or more independently inherited pairs of alleles, most likely influenced by additional modifiers genes) rather than a simple Mendelian trait.  Kallio and Revonsuo have proposed non-conscious neurophysiological precursors of veridical environmental perceptions as likely candidates for neurophysiological processes underpinning possible state-like changes in hypnosis !!!REF!!!. To assist such identification they have advocated the use of single case studies with virtuoso hypnotic subjects !!!REFs!!!. MMN is a well-known auditory event-related potential paradigm with an established topographical maximum over frontal electrodes. MMN is elicited to auditory stimuli by a sudden stimulus change (deviant) in a series of predictable (standard) stimuli and is calculated by subtracting the ERP to the standard stimulus from the ERP to the deviant stimulus. Each new auditory stimulus is compared to a representation in very short-term auditory memory built up from the preceding similar stimuli. The MMN corresponds to the detection of a discrepancy between the neural representation of the novel stimulus and the pre-existing neural template !!!REF!!!. The MMN is preconscious and occurs even in sleep or while attention is diverted to another task. Therefore it well fits the criterion of a non-conscious neurophysiological precursor of veridical environmental perceptions. Source localization studies indicate that the principal generators of the MMN (and its magnetic equivalent) are located bilaterally in the superior temporal gyrus, i.e. in the auditory cortex !!!REFs!!!. However, another important generator has also been identified in the right frontal cortex !!!REFs!!!. According to Näätänen !!!REF!!! the generators in the auditory cortex correspond to an automatic, pre-attentive, change detection mechanism, while the right frontal generator is likely to correspond to a process that recruits attentional resources to the detected change. Kallio et al. !!!REF!!! hypothesised that if hypnosis, in highly susceptible participants, results in a state of anterior inhibition, then the MMN (over frontal electrodes) should be diminished in hypnosis. Contrary to these predictions, in a single case study with a virtuoso hypnotic subject, they reported a significant increase in MMN in the hypnotised compared to the non-hypnotised condition at the fronto-centrally located electrode Fz. They concluded that this result failed to support the theory of frontal inhibition as a core feature of any state of hypnosis. Furthermore the exclusive reliance on single case studies of hypnotic virtuosos, though useful in themselves, has important limitations and needs to be supplemented by additional research strategies. Electro-physiological measures demonstrate a marked degree of inter-individual variability. It cannot be reliably inferred that because one individual shows a particular pattern of performance that this response will be generally shared. The generalisability of results to other highly susceptible subjects requires demonstration. It also appears to be assumed that the electro-physiological changes found in hypnosis by a virtuoso subject will not be matched by a subject with low susceptibility. It is presumed that because the participant with low susceptibility does not become hypnotised that they show no EEG changes in hypnosis, but this does not allow for neurophysiological sequelae such as adaptation to the test situation, anxiety reduction, familiarity with the task, etc. !!!REF!!!. It is dangerous to presume that simply because a highly susceptible subject shows a particular neurophysiological change in hypnosis that this is a feature of a hypnotic state !!!REFs!!!. Rather the identification of such differences is only one step in the process of specifying state-like transitions in some hypnotised individuals !!!REF!!!. In light of these considerations the present study seeks to replicate and extend the findings of Kallio et al. !!!REF!!! by studying MMN in groups of participants with low and high hypnotic susceptibility. Both frontal and temporal MMN components are tracked across pre-hypnosis, hypnosis, and post-hypnosis conditions. A roving standard paradigm !!!REF!!! is adopted to maximize the magnitude of the (otherwise often weak) temporal MMN component measured at the mastoid electrodes. Alternative explanations for the original MMN finding !!!REF!!! predict either a linear or quadratic pattern of change across the three successive testing conditions of the present experiment which may be directly tested by the use of linear or quadratic polynomial trend analysis. The effect of situational factors associated with the hypnosis condition (but not unique to those with high hypnotic susceptibility) is predicted to produce a quadratic trend across the experimental conditions in all subjects. However, the effect of factors uniquely engaged in those with high hypnotic susceptibility when in the hypnosis condition (i.e. the hypnotic state) is predicted to produce a quadratic trend in the interaction between experimental condition and susceptibility. An increase in the strength of auditory memory template building (a non-hypnotic cortical process) with task repetition is predicted to produce a linear trend across the experimental conditions in all subjects. Alternatively the effect of hypnotic susceptibility (independent of processes specifically engaged by hypnosis) on the temporal development of MMN is predicted to produce a linear trend in the interaction between experimental condition and susceptibility.  The dopamine D3 receptor is of interest in research on neuropsychiatric disorders due to its postulated role in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Owing to the D3 receptor's probable physiological importance several attempts have been made to develop selective ligands for the examination of D3 receptors in the brain !!!REFs!!!. Despite of all efforts no successful in vivo examination of the D3 receptor has been performed, yet. The distribution of dopamine D3 receptors has been described in rodent !!!REFs!!!, monkey !!!REF!!! and human brain !!!REF!!! by in vitro studies using radioligand binding. The highest densities of D3 receptors and D3 mRNA are found in the nucleus accumbens, the ventral caudate/putamen and the islands of Calleja in all species examined, whereas lower densities are found in the amygdala, substantia nigra and the ventral pallidum !!!REFs!!!. The D3 receptor is less widely expressed in the brain than the D2 receptor, and the density of the former receptor subtype is generally low. The low density implies that selective in vivo labeling of D3 receptors requires radioligands with exceptionally high selectivity and affinity for the D3 receptor. In addition, a physiological condition has been suggested to hamper in vivo examination of the D3 receptor. A series of evidences support the assumption that D3 receptors are occupied to a high degree by dopamine (DA) at physiological conditions !!!REFs!!!. Endogenous DA may thus prevent the binding of drugs and radioligands to the D3 receptors. In a previous series of experiments, we made an attempt to selectively label D3 receptors in the monkey brain with positron emission tomography (PET), using the D3-selective radioligand, [11C]RGH-1756 !!!REF!!!. Despite having high selectivity and affinity for D3 receptors in vitro !!!REFs!!! [11C]RGH-1756 displayed low specific binding to D3 receptors in the primate brain in vivo. The low binding of [11C]RGH-1756 could be explained either by competition with endogenous DA, or by the need for very high in vivo affinity needed to label the low densities of D3 receptors expressed in the brain. If the former assumption is correct experimental compounds which decrease the concentration of DA in the synaptic cleft might render more D3 receptors available for binding, and thereby increase the binding of [11C]RGH-1756. The catecholamine-depleting agent reserpine has been extensively used to study the effect of endogenous DA on the in vivo binding of dopaminergic radioligands with PET !!!REFs!!!. A single reserpine injection (1–5mg/kg) has been shown to cause 92–95% decrease in striatal DA concentration in rats !!!REFs!!!. After administration of 1mg/kg reserpine to cynomolgus monkeys the binding of [11C]raclopride increased by 50%, thereby confirmed that reserpine can be used to increase availability of DA receptors !!!REF!!!. The aim of the present study was to test whether the low specific binding of [11C]RGH-1756 in our previous study was caused by insufficient in vivo affinity of the ligand or by high occupancy of D3 receptors by endogenous DA. The effect of reserpine induced DA depletion on the binding of [11C]RGH-1756 to D3 receptors was examined in three cynomolgus monkeys.   The existence of the visual areas along the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES) of the feline brain was described in the 1980s !!!REFs!!!. Morphological studies revealed that these areas receive visual information bypassing the geniculo-striate system, through a cortical route via the lateral suprasylvian visual areas and through a tecto-thalamic route via the suprageniculate nucleus (Sg) and the lateral posterior nucleus pars medialis (LPm) of the thalamus !!!REFs!!!. The physiological properties of the LPm and its connections have been studied fairly widely !!!REFs!!!. The Sg, however, has attracted much less interest during the last 25 years, although the neurons in this thalamic nucleus exhibit special physiological properties. While the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relays the retinal input towards the primary visual cortex without causing any fundamental modification in the size of the receptive fields, the visual receptive fields in the Sg are rather dissimilar to those of the neurons of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) from where they receive their tectal visual afferentation. The receptive fields of the Sg neurons uniformly cover the whole extent of the visual field of the stimulated eye !!!REFs!!!. These receptive field properties can appear for two reasons. The strong convergence of the collicular fibres on the Sg !!!REF!!! could be responsible for the representation of the whole visual field. The Sg might mediate this information to the cortex, and thus the similarly huge receptive fields of the neurons along the AES !!!REFs!!! could be a consequence of the thalamic relaying of this convergence. On the other hand, the activity of the pathway between the visual associative cortex (AEV) and the Sg !!!REFs!!! could also result in the large receptive fields of Sg neurons. This raises at least two important questions concerning the visual information processing and flow between the AES cortex and the Sg: is the internal organization of the large receptive fields of the Sg units similar to or different from that of the AEV !!!REFs!!!? Then, as regards the direction of the information flow, are the cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical routes equally active during visual information processing? We attempted to aquire data which would clarify these problems by recording single-unit responses to visual stimulation both in the AEV and in the Sg of the feline brain. The stimulation was performed by moving a randomly selected portion of a large visual white-noise pattern in front of the animal. Earlier use of the same stimulation set-up revealed that within each visual receptive field of the neurons in the AES cortex there is a “hot-spot”, i.e. a region which is preferentially sensitive to visual stimulation !!!REF!!!. The location of this region varies among the neurons, providing a possibility for a non-traditional spatial coding of signals in the visual field !!!REFs!!!. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of sites of maximum sensitivity within the large receptive fields of the Sg neurons and compared the organization of the receptive fields in the AEV and the Sg. We further calculated the latencies of the AEV and the Sg visual responses. Comparison of the AEV and Sg latencies could possibly shed light on the direction of information flow between the AEV and the Sg and may provide an indication as to whether the cortico-thalamic volley first reaches the thalamus, or whether the SC causes the initial excitation in the neurons of the Sg.  Electroencephalographic somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) evoked by stimulation of peripheral somatosensory fibres appear as a waveform consisting of positive and negative peaks with different amplitudes and time of onset after stimulation, which are altered by drugs primarily suppressing the perception of noxious stimuli (analgesic drugs). Since SEP waveforms evoked by high intensity stimulation, represent neural processing of noxious stimuli !!!REFs!!! and since neural processing of noxious stimuli is affected by analgesic drugs, analgesic drug-induced changes in SEP waveforms are considered to be related to an altered nociceptive state !!!REF!!!. Therefore, the SEP can be considered a potential indicator of analgesic efficacy during general anaesthesia. In the rat, SEP monitoring in the 10–30ms latency range in relation to nociception and analgesia, has been largely neglected in the literature. SEP components in this latency range may provide the advantage that these components correspond with synaptic connections early in the neural pathway and consist of simple, sequential connections (primary processing of sensory information) making the interpretation of these waves relatively straightforward. In contrast, later waves are believed to reflect a summation of diverse, synchronous activity in the brain arising from multiple, diffuse projections in the neural pathway (higher processing of sensory information) making the interpretation of these waves more complex. Further, based on a comparison between findings from separate experiments with underlying methodological variation in recording and eliciting SEPs in the rat, SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range are thought to be of special interest in relation to nociception and analgesia !!!REFs!!!. Most SEP studies in rats have been focused on SEPs recorded over the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) (SI-SEPs) !!!REFs!!!. SI-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range have been shown to be negligibly affected by hypnotic (‘sleep’-inducing) and/or analgesic drugs and to be relatively insensitive to increasing stimulus frequency !!!REFs!!!. These SI-SEP components are considered to reflect activity in the primary somatosensory pathway !!!REFs!!! (thalamocortical projection via the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus (VPL) to the SI) functionally involving somatosensation per se !!!REFs!!!. In contrast to SI-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range, SEPs recorded over the vertex (Vx-SEPs) in the similar latency range, are highly sensitive to anaesthetic drugs and habituate rapidly to increasing stimulus frequency !!!REFs!!!. The characteristics of these Vx-SEP components have led to our working hypothesis !!!REF!!! that, in contrast to SI-SEP components, the Vx-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range, are an early manifestation of activity in the medial spinothalamic/reticular projections to limbic and forebrain areas involving discriminating between relevant and irrelevant somatosensory stimuli !!!REFs!!!, rather than somatosensation per se involving activity in the primary somatosensory pathway !!!REFs!!!. Consequently, the Vx-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range, rather than those of the SI-SEP, may be of special interest in relation to nociception and analgesia. Recently, we established that SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range are of special interest in relation to nociception and analgesia !!!REF!!!. First, the primary positive component (P) with respect to its following negative component (N) of the SI-SEP occurring at 12ms (P12) and 20ms (N20), respectively, and the Vx-SEP P15–N20 evoked by standardised methodology, were sensitive to the μ-opiate receptor agonist fentanyl. Both Aβ- (tactile processing) and Aδ-mediated (nociception) responses can be found within the 10–30ms latency range !!!REFs!!!. Since μ-opiate receptor agonists selectively modulate nociceptive processing, but not tactile processing !!!REFs!!!, the SI-SEP P12–N20 and Vx-SEP P15–N20 have been considered to be nociceptive in nature (Aδ-mediated), rather than mechanosensitive (Aβ-mediated) !!!REF!!!. This is of primary importance when these components are to be used as indicators of analgesic efficacy. Second, in contrast to the SI-SEP, the Vx-SEP was affected more by increasing stimulus frequency and different hypnotic and/or analgesic drugs following standardised methodology !!!REF!!! supporting the hypothesis that SI-SEP and Vx-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range reflect neural events involved in a different fashion in primary processing of somatosensory information. However, it needs to be determined whether the differences between these SI-SEP and Vx-SEP components can be related to the primary processing in separate functional pathways such as the primary somatosensory pathway and spinothalamic/reticular projections to limbic and forebrain areas, respectively. The aim of the present study was to characterise SI-SEP and Vx-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range in relation to the anatomy and function of the primary somatosensory pathway. Therefore, we investigated to which extent SI-SEP and Vx-SEP components in the 10–30ms latency range corresponded with SEP components in the similar latency range recorded from the VPL, as nucleus known to be part of the subcortical structure of the primary somatosensory pathway. The effect of increasing stimulus intensity and frequency and the effect of fentanyl on these SEPs in the 10–30ms latency range were investigated.  Mild cognitive impairment is a term indicating a transitional stage between normal ageing and dementia !!!REF!!!. Clinically, it refers to an impairment in one or more cognitive domains, usually memory, in subjects with an adequate general functioning, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for dementia !!!REF!!!. Mild cognitive impairment is not a definite nosological entity, but a new entity with numerous proposed classification criteria !!!REFs!!!. The current lack of agreement on definition arouses concern about the validity of comparisons among studies which use different criteria to assess cognitive impairment !!!REFs!!!. This disagreement poses, also, problems for clinicians, as early therapeutic intervention requires to identify a specific high-risk population !!!REF!!!. Most studies generally include populations with only a very small proportion of persons aged 90 years and over, which, in most western countries, represent the fastest growing part of the elderly population !!!REF!!!. Moreover, in very old people, it may be even more problematic to distinguish between early manifestations of dementia, cognitive impairment, and changes associated with “normal ageing” !!!REFs!!!. This study was designed to explore the occurrence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), according to recommendations of the International Working Group on MCI !!!REF!!!, among nonagenarians and centenarians, and to compare this definition to other broadly used concepts: the Age-Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI) !!!REF!!!, the Cognitive Impairment, No Dementia (CIND) !!!REFs!!! and the Questionable Dementia stage of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR 0.5) !!!REF!!!. The degree of concordance between MCI and the other classification criteria was also examined. The data were gathered from the Bologna and Ravenna Study on Dementia in Nonagenarians and Centenarians !!!REFs!!!.  The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1), formerly called vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1), is a non-selective cation channel with high Ca2+ permeability, activated by noxious heat and sensitised by acid !!!REF!!!, whose activation produces immediate nociceptor excitation !!!REF!!!. It is also well established that the tonic stimulation of TRPV1 can lead to analgesic effects through receptor desensitisation !!!REF!!! or even the degeneration of nociceptive fibres !!!REFs!!!. Both mechanisms may help to explain the use of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin in the management of certain painful pathologies, such as neuropathies !!!REF!!!. Moreover, the analgesic properties of TRPV1 agonists have been demonstrated experimentally in inflammatory processes. Thus, the systemic administration of resiniferatoxin prevents either complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)- !!!REF!!! or carrageenan-induced !!!REF!!! thermal hyperalgesia in rats and the local injection of capsaicin abolishes thermal hyperalgesic responses induced by both agents in mice !!!REF!!!. Apart from exhibiting a high efficacy in the relief of inflammatory hyperalgesia, it might be remarked that the analgesic effect induced by TRPV1 agonists in inflamed animals is rather long lasting !!!REFs!!!, being considerably longer than that observed in non-inflamed animals !!!REF!!!. In fact, a detailed analysis of the above mentioned data reveals that the analgesic effect induced by a single dose of a TRPV1 agonist lasts approximately the same time as the hyperalgesia observed in solvent-treated inflamed animals !!!REFs!!!, in such a way that the persistence of the analgesic effect of the TRPV1 agonist seems to be adjusted to the underlying pathology. On the other hand, the endogenous vanilloid system is clearly involved in the development and maintenance of inflammatory hyperalgesia. In fact, the release during inflammation of protons or several molecules – globally called endovanilloids – able to stimulate TRPV1 !!!REFs!!! or contribute, such as bradykinin, neural growth factor or ATP, to receptor sensitisation !!!REFs!!! has been repeatedly reported. Furthermore, the up-regulation of TRPV1 in inflamed tissues has been also proven !!!REFs!!! and a correlation between TRPV1 expression and thermal inflammatory hyperalgesia has been established in rats !!!REF!!!. These data make it understandable that either the blockade of TRPV1 with antagonists !!!REFs!!! or the deletion of its expression in knockout mice !!!REFs!!! induces a considerable reduction of inflammatory hyperalgesia. We explore here whether the long-term analgesia induced by capsaicin in inflamed mice is accompanied by the TRPV1 unresponsiveness and, if so, whether the endovanilloids released during inflammation could be involved in this process. With this aim in mind, we initially tested if the acute nociceptive licking behavior induced by a low dose of capsaicin is also decreased after the previous administration of an analgesic dose of capsaicin. We have therefore studied whether the administration of the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine could block the prolongation of capsaicin analgesia in inflamed tissues once such is established.  The acute phase response is the immediate set of host inflammatory reactions that counteract challenges, such as tissue injury, infection and trauma. This response leads to changes in the circulating plasma protein profile, reflecting the synthesis and secretion of proteins involved in immune function and tissue repair !!!REF!!!. After tissue injury or infection, macrophages and monocytes near the damaged site detect the infectious agent or damaged cells and respond with a wave synthesis of cytokines, mainly of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These cytokines trigger the surrounding cell types, such as fibroblasts and blood vessel endothelial cells, to respond with an amplified wave of cytokine synthesis. A significant amount of these cytokines is transported in the blood stream and triggers the acute-phase response in other tissues, such as the liver and brain. Excessive production of these inflammatory mediators contributes to damage in neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) !!!REFs!!!. It is well established that hippocampal and cortical tissues are susceptible to degeneration in response to insult, such as oxidative stress or infection. Our previous study clearly showed a robust brain inflammation in the mice after subcutaneous administration of silver nitrate !!!REFs!!!. The brain, as a stressor causing changes in central neurotransmitter systems, interprets immune challenge induced by the inflammation. Several studies suggest that aminergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons in particular, are susceptible to inflammatory insult, although the effects vary depending on the place of inflammation induction. Dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) have been identified as the principal transmitters mediating fast excitatory synaptic responses in the vertebrate central nervous system and have widespread influence on the cortex, basal ganglia, limbic areas and spinal cord. They play an important role in regulation of brain functions: memory, mood, movement, behavior and autonomic functions, such as blood pressure regulation. α-Crystallin, a lens structural protein, comprising α-A and α-B subunits is an ubiquitous molecular chaperone, which has been shown to protect many enzymes from inactivation and heat-induced aggregation !!!REF!!!. α-Crystallin has also been shown to decrease the degree of thiol oxidation of other lens crystallin's under conditions of oxidative stress !!!REF!!!. In recent years, α-crystallin has been shown to prevent apoptosis induced by various agents including TNF-α !!!REF!!!, ultraviolet radiation !!!REF!!! and hydrogen peroxide !!!REF!!!. Earlier, we have shown that α-crystallin reduces ROS production and protect anti-oxidant enzymes during acute inflammation !!!REF!!!. In this work, we have examined the mechanistic aspects of α-crystallin's protective function in inflammation-triggered neurotoxicity.  The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, responsible for mediating the majority of intracellular proteolysis, plays a crucial role in the regulation of many normal cellular processes, including the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis !!!REFs!!!. Defects in proteasome function have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease !!!REF!!!. Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells characterized by nuclear fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome release and caspase activation !!!REFs!!!. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and AcLLNaI induce apoptotic death in human glioma cells by a mitochondria-independent mechanism !!!REF!!!. In addition, it is uncertain whether the cytotoxicity of MG132 is mediated by elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ levels !!!REFs!!!. Disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and defects in mitochondrial function mediate neuronal cell death !!!REFs!!!. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species !!!REF!!!. Ca2+ overload may excessively activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathways and leads to irreversible cell damage !!!REF!!!. Calmodulin antagonists such as W-7 and trifluoperazine inhibit cell death due to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or veratridine-induced depolarization !!!REFs!!!. Trifluoperazine as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition is demonstrated to reduce oxidative stress-induced cell death by suppressing the cytochrome release and mitochondrial depolarization !!!REFs!!!. Meanwhile, phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, show a strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against neuronal cells and leukemic cells !!!REFs!!!. MG132, which effectively blocks the proteolytic activity of 26S proteasome complex, causes apoptotic cell death through formation of ROS !!!REFs!!!. Although calmodulin antagonist such as trifluoperazine is demonstrated to reduce oxidative cell injury, the effect on mitochondrial damage and apoptotic cell death due to MG132 has not been elucidated. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine, W-7 and calmidazolium) on the MG132-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in PC12 cells. This study examined the effect of calmodulin antagonists on mitochondrial damage and subsequent cytochrome release, changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, formation of ROS and cellular GSH contents. \""
